\l After one year, my friend and her husband and I traveled all the way to Spain.

\l And we arrived in Stockholm and I went home.

\t Ii 'nakwhl 'wihl wili'm, gwila'lhl g̲anuutxw, g̲an wihl needii lax̲'nisxwi'y g̲oohl Gigeenix.
\g 
\l And we were away a long time, three weeks, and that's why I didn't hear from Gigeenix.

\t Ii yee'y g̲oohl anhahla'lsdi'y.
\g 
\l And I went to my work.

\t Ap yukwhl ha'niisgwaa'ytxw.

\l And I went there and I got my mail.

\g 
\l And before I went home I had a short pee in the bathroom.

\t Ii daayimaahl wili'y g̲an wina sg̲at'akwhl aats'ip.
\g 
\l And I don't know why I locked the door.

\t Ii hlaa yukwhl dim xsawi'y ii needii 'nim k̲'ak̲hl aats'ip.
\g 
\l And I was going to go out but the door didn't want to open.

\t Ii xsi hlguxwsxwi'y, ii lip ligi agwihl bag̲a'y, ii ap neet.
\g 
\l And I couldn't get out, and whatever I tried I couldn't get out.

\t Ii k̲'aa 'nii giihli'y lax̲ ha'niiwan.
\g 
\l And I laid on the floor for a while.

\t Ak̲hl ligi 'wihl he'y.
\g 
\l I didn't know what to think. || I had no thoughts at all.

\t Ii 'nii yatshl pipe-- nii gya'a wil sgihl pipe aloohl ha'niiyo'oxsxw.
\g 
\l And I hit the pipe-- I saw there was a pipe on the sink.

\t Nii xhlii guut iin yatshl pole loot, upja ligi 'wihl wihl ligit naa.
\g 
\l And I took it apart, and I hit the pole with the pipe in case anybody was around.

\t Ii neediit naa ji 'witxwit.
\g 
\l But no one came.

\t Agwiyukwhl ha'niisgwaa'ytxwhl g̲an wihl neediit naa ji hahla'ljit.
\g 
\l Because it was Sunday, no one was at work.

\t Ii hehl t'ilx̲ootxwi'y, "Dim aam dim wili'y, yukwhl bax̲hl aks."
\g 
\l And my thoughts said, "I will be alright because there is running water."

\t "Ii ak̲hl ligi 'wihl baasxi'y g̲oosun."
\g 
\l "And there is nothing for me to fear here."

\t Ii giihli'y, ii si'ix wok̲si'y.
\g 
\l And I laid down, and tried to sleep.

\t Ii ap neet, g̲an wina guuhl hlgu pipe gi nii yatshl aats'ip loot.

\l But no, that's why I took the little pipe and I hit the door with it.

\t Ii hlaa amhl g̲a'nagwit iin gya'ahl g̲adaaxhl wilp xseek̲.
\g 
\l And after a while I was able to see the outside of the bathroom.

\t Nii japhl 'wii luu no'o dim xsi yuwi'y, ii 'nithl wili'y.
\g 
\l I made a big hole to go through, and that's what I did.

\t Hlaa xsa'ak̲xwi'y 'nii g̲ayoo ts'imil t'aahlihl jabi'y g̲oohl ts'im wilp xseek̲.

\l We went back to work and I wondered why the men kept coming into my office.

\g 
\l And they said, "Oh, this is the Canadanska flika [Canadian girl] who broke the toilet."
