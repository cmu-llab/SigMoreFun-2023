\l A long time ago, I lived overseas where the white people lived.

\t Ii na 'wahl anhahla'lst g̲oohl Stockholm sawatdiit.
\m ii n 'wa-hl an-hahla'lst g̲oo-hl Stockholm si-wa-t-diit
\g 
\l And I found work in Stockholm, that's what they call it.

\t Ii hahla'lsdi'y g̲oohl IBM.

\g 
\l And I worked for IBM.

\g 
\l After one year, my friend and her husband and I traveled all the way to Spain.

\t Ii hlaa guxws luu yaltxu'm ii basax̲xu'm g̲oohl Denmark.
\m ii hlaa guxws luu yalt-xw-'m ii baasax̲-xw-'m g̲oo-hl Denmark

\l And on the way back we separated in Denmark.

\t Ii na yuxwhl train ii yee'y g̲oohl Stockholm.
\m ii n yuxw-hl train ii yee-'y g̲oo-hl Stockholm
\g 
\l And I took the train and I went to Stockholm.

\t Ii hlaa bagu'm g̲oohl Stockholm ii ha'wi'y.
\m ii hlaa bakw-'m g̲oo-hl Stockholm ii ha'w-'y
\g 
\l And we arrived in Stockholm and I went home.

\m ii 'nakw-hl 'wihl wil-'m gwila'l-hl g̲anuutxw g̲an wil-hl nee-dii lax̲'ni-sxw-'y g̲oo-hl gi-geenix
\g 
\l And we were away a long time, three weeks, and that's why I didn't hear from Gigeenix.

\t Ii yee'y g̲oohl anhahla'lsdi'y.
\m ii yee-'y g̲oo-hl an-hahla'lst-'y
\g 
\l And I went to my work.

\t Ap yukwhl ha'niisgwaa'ytxw.
\m ap yukw-hl ha-'nii-sgwaa'ytxw
\g 
\l But it was Sunday.

\t Ii neediit naa dim 'witxwit.

\g 
\l And no one would be there.

\t Ii yee'y loot nii dok̲hl mail'y.

\l And I went there and I got my mail.

\m ii hla-g̲ook̲ dim ha'w-'y ii ky'aa isxw-'y g̲oo-hl wilp xseek̲
\g 
\l And before I went home I had a short pee in the bathroom.

\t Ii daayimaahl wili'y g̲an wina sg̲at'akwhl aats'ip.
\m ii daa-imaa-hl wil-'y g̲an wil-ni sg̲a-t'akw-hl aats'ip

\l And I don't know why I locked the door.

\t Ii hlaa yukwhl dim xsawi'y ii needii 'nim k̲'ak̲hl aats'ip.
\m ii hlaa yukw-hl dim xsaxw-'y ii nee-dii 'nim k̲'ak̲-hl aats'ip

\l And I was going to go out but the door didn't want to open.

\m ii xsi hlguxws-xw-'y ii lip ligi agwi-hl bak̲-a-'y ii ap nee-t
\g 
\l And I couldn't get out, and whatever I tried I couldn't get out.

\t Ii k̲'aa 'nii giihli'y lax̲ ha'niiwan.
\m ii k̲'aa 'nii giihl-'y lax̲ ha-'nii-wan
\g 
\l And I laid on the floor for a while.

\t Ak̲hl ligi 'wihl he'y.
\m ak̲-hl ligi 'wihl he-'y
\g 
\l I didn't know what to think. || I had no thoughts at all.

\t Ii 'nii yatshl pipe-- nii gya'a wil sgihl pipe aloohl ha'niiyo'oxsxw.
\m ii 'nii yats-hl pipe n-ii gya'a wil sgi-hl pipe a-loo-hl ha-'nii-yo'oxs-xw
\g 
\l And I hit the pipe-- I saw there was a pipe on the sink.

\t Nii xhlii guut iin yatshl pole loot, upja ligi 'wihl wihl ligit naa.
\m n-ii xhlii guu-t ii-n yats-hl pole loo-t up-ji ligi 'wihl wil-hl ligi-t naa
\g 
\l And I took it apart, and I hit the pole with the pipe in case anybody was around.

\t Ii neediit naa ji 'witxwit.
\m ii nee-dii-t naa ji 'witxw-it
\g 
\l But no one came.

\t Agwiyukwhl ha'niisgwaa'ytxwhl g̲an wihl neediit naa ji hahla'ljit.
\m agwiyukw-hl ha-'nii-sgwaa'ytxw-hl g̲an wil-hl nee-dii-t naa ji hahla'lst-it
\g 
\l Because it was Sunday, no one was at work.

\t Ii hehl t'ilx̲ootxwi'y, "Dim aam dim wili'y, yukwhl bax̲hl aks."
\m ii he-hl t'ilx̲oo-txw-'y dim aam dim wil-'y yukw-hl bax̲-hl aks
\g 
\l And my thoughts said, "I will be alright because there is running water."

\t "Ii ak̲hl ligi 'wihl baasxi'y g̲oosun."
\m ii ak̲-hl ligi 'wihl baasx-i-'y g̲oo-s-xwin
\g 
\l "And there is nothing for me to fear here."

\t Ii giihli'y, ii si'ix wok̲si'y.
\m ii giihl-'y ii si'ix wok̲-s-'y
\g 
\l And I laid down, and tried to sleep.

\t Ii ap neet, g̲an wina guuhl hlgu pipe gi nii yatshl aats'ip loot.
\m ii ap nee-t g̲an wil-na guu-hl hlgu pipe gi n-ii yats-hl aats'ip loo-t
\g 
\l But no, that's why I took the little pipe and I hit the door with it.

\t Ii hlaa amhl g̲a'nagwit iin gya'ahl g̲adaaxhl wilp xseek̲.
\m ii hlaa am-hl g̲a-'nakw-it ii-n gya'a-hl g̲adaax-hl wilp xseek̲
\g 
\l And after a while I was able to see the outside of the bathroom.

\t Nii japhl 'wii luu no'o dim xsi yuwi'y, ii 'nithl wili'y.
\m n-ii jap-hl 'wii luu no'o dim xsi yuxw-i-'y ii 'nit-hl wil-'y
\g 
\l I made a big hole to go through, and that's what I did.

\t Hlaa xsa'ak̲xwi'y 'nii g̲ayoo ts'imil t'aahlihl jabi'y g̲oohl ts'im wilp xseek̲.
\m hlaa xsi-'ak̲xw-'y n-ii g̲ay-hoo ts'imil t'aahl-i-hl jap-i-'y g̲oo-hl ts'im wilp xseek̲
\g 
\l When I made it out, then I put what I had done (the rubble) back in the bathroom.

\t Hlaa yukwhl hahla'lsdi'm ii ha'niig̲oodi'y wihl ii'uxwt g̲anwilat 'nii yuxwdiithl office'y.
\m hlaa yukw-hl hahla'lst-'m ii ha-'nii-g̲oot-'y wil-hl ii'uxwt g̲ani-wila-t 'nii yuxw-diit-hl office-'y
\g 
\l We went back to work and I wondered why the men kept coming into my office.

\t Ii hediit, "Oo, 'nit Canadanska flika tun ant kw'asinhl wilp xseek̲."
\m ii he-diit oo 'nit Canadanska flika t-un an-t kw'as-in-hl wilp xseek̲
\g 
\l And they said, "Oh, this is the Canadanska flika [Canadian girl] who broke the toilet."
