\l The son was rejecting, "Whatever you do, I won't tell."

\t Baxumeseda äƛiru šebin rok’ƛ’o č’aq’ˤinosi, ʕAliqiličä k’oƛin ik’in aždaħes q’ˤim č’ikayä rezurno.
\g 
\l When he remembered what Bakhumesed said, Aliqilich ran and showed the dragon's head in the mirror to himself.

\t Eloš neła zam-zames łäs q’ut’u där bic’a betinƛin, užä žawab teƛno.
\g 
\l "I wanted to fill the jug with the holy water over there.", the boy answered.

\l When the second traveller pulled out a leaf and gave it to the hunter, the snake started to yell from within his belly: "Don't eat the leaf, I'm coming out!"

\t C’odorawni esiya yisiq esirno, q’ili bisƛ’oräy mi šebi eƛäƛin.
\g 
\l The clever brother asked him: "When you got the qili, what did you say?"

\t Sasaq qaħłi begirnosi, Ismaʕilän, ʕArabuzanän gulubin rˤaƛoyn, ħadur boqno bičin.
\g 
\l The next day, after the sun rose, Ismail and Arabuzan harnessed the horses and got prepared.

\t Šebigo oqłin ža dey esiw yoł.
\g 
\l Whoever he was, he is my brother.

\g 
\l When he saw the prince getting up from his sleep in the morning and hanging his head, the sister's husband asked him: "What happened to you; why are you so sad?"

\t Nesiłgon xizaz iłetow salamno teƛno, žeduł teł heresi mec esixosi ayn q’ˤida ičin.
\g 
\l The liar came greeting from behind, went to join them and sat down.

\g 
\l "Did you meet a camel, while you were going along this way?"

\t Ža didurƛin yisä esirnosi, nesi užä eƛin, sis ħumukulin bisno, neła tełäy axorekasin roɣno elo teł mi eqra ayƛin.

\l When he asked: "How that?", the boy said: "You must buy a camel, remove its giblets and put yourself inside!

\t Debez kidbez kočorał uqˤłäsi zowsƛin, esin yisä.
\g 
\l "I was hidden in your daughter's hair," the boy told.

\t Bara ɣunoxorno yik’in, gonda tełxor akrošawt’ani magalazas čantan kurno, riynoxuq nełar ħažataw, q’ʷarʕaraw łinałäyn esirno.

\l The wife went to the tree, spread out the pocket with the cheese breads into the hole and asked the sheikh what would be necessary.

\t Ža azbar ʕoƛno kawu yołäsi zown.
\g 
\l The palace had seven gates.

\t Zownƛax zownč’eyƛax bˤeƛon, boc’in, zirun, qˤayno.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there were a pig, a wolf, a fox and a hare.

\t Gegmun ɣirƛin at’ q’uq’anir łi roqinč’izaƛ’ yiza yisiqor eƛin:
\g 
\l They sifted the flour and because there was no water to knead the dough, they said to him:

\t ƛirbar kidbä äƛiru łinasno maʕnan biynč’ey xander ik’in, hemeł kidbä däz sualyor hemedur žawab neƛsiƛin.
\g 
\l The guest didn't understand why the girl said that, went to the king and said "This girl has given me such an answer on my question."

\t Zamanaƛ’aza nesir sis aɣi bukayx.
\g 
\l After some time he saw a bird.

\t Hemedur uynon rok’uɣʷeymoƛ’ hunix rik’iƛ’oräy, žedar bexuräsi boc’i besun.
\g 
\l So when the four of them went on their way happily, they found a wolf who was killed.

\t Nedur resunäyƛin, utin nesiƛ’ar xan debex di kid yegira yoł, amma ža t’akan mi yayrno yesunč’inäy, debi di meč’ beč’a yołƛin.
\g 
\l "If that's the case", the king turned to him, "I will marry my daughter off to you, but if it's not the case that you brought the glass, I will cut off your head."

\t Nełas gondu yałruni mečoƛ’or baynosi, ža elo tełxor biħusƛin.
\g 
\l When we came to the place where its hole was, it went inside.

\t Yizin xaličabin ok’qo rixin, xedyoqor yezun barun yičin.
\g 
\l The wife got up, hung the mats onto a nail and waited for her husband.

\t Di yaqˤuł xizor ik’ix, däz meča xanłun yeda užin egirno, di nesis hič’č’a eženi wazirłun oqxoƛin”.
\g 
\l "I abdicate today; instead of me, I let this boy be king, I become his eldest vizier."

\t Yizin yik’in q’orolay esnabi bičixozo mečoƛ’or yaynosi, elo idu sisxoli esiy yesun.
\g 
\l The widow got up, went to the place where the siblings lived and found the sister alone at home.

\t Howži bazarganza yisiqor eƛin, neširu mi idur ik’ixanusi elur riyxƛin.
\g 
\l Now the merchants said to him: "We know that you won't go home tonight."

\t Ža lelno žimäɣor eqerno, xanes eɣeni uži oqno iduɣor ik’in.
\g 
\l The khan's youngest son put the feather in his pocket and went home.

\t Nesił adäza anusi šebintow zown anu, hudun nesiq elay risno siskin šebin rac’ełxo zown anu hemedur yeda yałzay elor łˤonon esnabi bayn.

\l No matter what he had before himself, he couldn't take and eat anything; meanwhile three brothers came there.

\t Meko rok’ƛ’or raynosi, sida ʕaƛoz raʕalłix išʷanixƛin q’ˤida ičin.
\g 
\l When he noticed his hunger, he sat down to eat at the suburb of a village.

\t Nuci teƛno bäqirun, reƛ teƛno bäqirun šinaw micxir bazarganza q’orolaz užiqor butirno.
\g 
\l The merchants gave all the money they got for selling honey and for selling meat to the widow's son.

\t Užin č’arik’no neła eƛin, eliz ɣˤutkoł adäza mesedyos ƛ’ˤu yołäsi ɣˤutku yoł, łasey ža resanƛin.

\t Xediya eƛin, di saparyox ik’in xizor utin ayzaƛ’or, iday baru där gugäsi yesusƛin.
\g 
\l The husband said: "Before I came back from a journey, I found my wife had escaped from my home."

\t Tełazatow ac seruxosin, ħišixosin, ža yexurxosin rekarbi dowqor neƛan.
\g 
\l And I will give you the keys which will unlock, lock the door and demolish it.

\t Nełarno maxšel betixosi.
\g 
\l And that requires skill.

\t Ħažin q’ˤunan esnaza gedmabi hunix rik’iƛ’tow.
\g 
\l The two sisters exchanged their shirts while on their way.

\t Q’arƛ’otow izin ik’in yisä xanqo esin, neširu q’orolaz iday, hemedur, beɣe xexzas där guru teqsi, žedu xexbi debikin besač’ineyƛin.

\l He got up early, went to the king and told him: "So yesterday night I heard the crying of young children from the widow's home; couldn't those children be yours?"

\t Däz žas halmaɣbi yoł yiziƛin, esin nesä Ražbadinqo.
\g 
\l "They're my son's friends.", he told Razhbadin.

\t Žedu beɣet’atow yałzay xexbi eniwn yexun ƛexunƛax.
\g 
\l When these children were young, their mother died.

\t Daruyar ħumukulis reƛ riqač’ineyƛin maħor yoqäsi zows, debez esiwqay ence dahaw räqiru reƛno risno yik’ix hoboyƛin, eƛin q’orolayä.
\g 
\l "I didn't get camel's meat for a medicine.", she came outside, "Now I got a little bit from your sister and am going now.", the widow said.

\t Kecno moƛał ʕumru bäk’iru debi,
\g 
\l The life you led was in a dream,

\t Ɣˤʷayä žubi bac’nosi, howlotow bexun ža.
\g 
\l After the dog had eaten the liver, it died on the spot.

\t Sida ʕomoyä eƛin, däƛ’ ci Ħišoƛin yołƛin, sidenägon ʕAbdal yołƛin, łˤora äƛirägon Qˤaƛuƛin yołƛin.

\l One donkey said: "My name is Hisho [Shut].", another one said: "Mine is Abdal [Idiot]." and the third one said: "I am Qatlhu [Shout]."

\t Žedus sistow sis uži zowno.
\g 
\l They had only one son.

\t Minaraƛ’ay wˤałer oqno soder ezunosi dandi ža bercinawni ɣˤanabi elo ƛ’iri yukayx - hudu di wˤałer oqzey ʕiyayx oqxo.

\l When I walk down the minaret and look up I only see this beautiful woman -- so I am crying when I walk down.

\t Bazaryaɣorno ik’in nesä boc’es ħošin teƛno, nełaƛ bäqiru micxiryoƛ Bac’alä čanyabin risno.

\l He went to the market, sold the wolf's hide and for the money he got for it Batsali bought goats.

\t Xanä eƛin, osiw ezä teł yałru däz kidbeder ik’iłxo oqinč’izaƛ’ dicego baq’ˤu micxir yałru žek’ukin.
\g 
\l The king said: "No matter how much money a man has, he cannot go to my daughter who is inside the high fortress."

\g 
\l Very soon after the nestlings hatched, a fox came to the tree and shouted to the bird: "If you don't throw me one nestling down, I'll knock down the tree with my tail and eat up all your nestlings!"

\t Di yiła kidbes maharno roɣsi, yiłaq dey bašakin buyn bitinč’u.
\g 
\l I got divorced from that girl and indeed didn't even touch her with my finger.

\t Didiwgon ža oqłin di nesix yik’ixƛin, kid yet’un k’oƛin yičin.
\g 
\l "No matter what happens to him, I will go to him!," the girl [said and] ran away.

\t Maħiqor micxir bäciruni ɣˤʷayn teƛno, yisä xanes uži hunix egirno.
\g 
\l He gave him the dog with the money tied to its tail and sent the prince on his way.

\g 
\l "Come, we'll go looking.", and he led his brothers to show them the horses, and then he led them to the room where he was hiding the king's daughters, "So here are the three daughters."

\t Kidbez babiya eƛin, dey halmaɣ, šida mi äƛiru t’ubazi royxanu, mi elur howži äxuzay izin ayru iłe iyxƛin.
\g 
\l The girl's father said: "My friend, why would I not fulfill what you said? We now have the feeling as if you came from getting up while you were dying."

\t Žeduł roƛosi šebin čuqˤnosi, xanä wazirzaqorno eƛin uži tełer kurerno.
\g 
\l When he noticed what is between them, the king told his viziers to throw the boy into jail.

\t Yołƛin, žawab teƛno nesä esirnok’ur.
\g 
\l "I am." he answered the beggar.

\t Yet’un k’oƛin kidbä eƛin, ža šebin t’ubazi rodanix di ƛ’iri risxoƛin.
\g 
\l The girl jumped up, ran and said: "I am taking over in order to fulfill this thing."

\t Elaygon bitor bik’iƛ’oräy, nełar hunix zey keze baqno.
\g 
\l While he went on, he met a bear on the way.

\t Xizyogon urɣizin oqno, tusnaq’äsini uži egirno däder aƛin, amru bodin.
\g 
\l Then he thought about it and ordered the boy out of the prison to him.

\t Sisxolisini q’orolas uži ziya bexadanix razi oqno.
\g 
\l The lonely widow's son agreed to slaughter the cow.

\t Bezunč’ey ziru idurno bik’in, boƛƛäyr riłis q’ut’un bižin xizor butin yałza mečołxor zeydäɣor bik’in.
\g 
\l Without looking back, the fox went home, ate the butter out of the earthen jug up to the half, returned back to the field and went to the bear.

\t Posures ʕadlu sadaq zawru ɣˤʷayä boyx zown.
\g 
\l And a dog that was together [with her] brought the cattle in order.

\t Mežiz madaxay däz madaxor mi mesedyos qˤiƛurabi roynäy, debez žax di kid yegiranƛin eniwƛ’or xabar bayn.
\g 
\l The mother got the answer: "If you can build golden stairs from your door to my door, I will send my daughter to your son."

\t Salamno teƛno, yisi užä esirno, deber ħalt’uqan etixanaƛin.
\g 
\l The boy greeted him and asked: "Don't you need a worker?"

\t Debi zikru łiyace ičäsi zowsƛin, užä žawab teƛno.
\g 
\l "I was waiting until your recitation is finished.", answered the boy.

\t Šebi roqno deber, tusnaq’ä yałru dikinwa necet’a ixiw muši kurxanuƛin, žoyä bayan bisnosi, neła hemedur q’ˤano t’umi bayräsi yoł, žedałäy nasi guluči, nasi aqiw bat’a boda koƛ’inč’ey ƛexasiƛin esin.
\g 
\l "What happened to you? Even I, who I am in prison, don't moan so much!", the boy wanted to know, and she told him so: "Two pigeons were brought and it remains unknown how to distinguish which of them is male and which is female!"

\t Nełaƛ’ užin razi oqno.
\g 
\l The boy agreed on that.

\t Debez ħumukulis keč’oƛ’asi ozuri becono zowwäƛin?”
\g 
\l "Was you camel's left eye blind?"

\t Neła nesiq esirno, mi šebi žek’u yoł, nazay, didur mi t’or ayäƛin.
\g 
\l She asked him, " Who are you? And where do you come from?"

\t Elogon yisir č’agu yoqäsi kidbes eniwn yesun.
\g 
\l And there he found that his daughter's mother had become alive.

\t Boxin žan, xizay k’oƛin yizirin bik’iƛ’oräy, sidaɣ ɣˤayz iħuƛ’ozoni ƛeraxor bayza mečoƛ’, ozƛäy bˤeƛ’q’u bok’ełno.
\g 
\l While it ran away and they were riding behind it, the sheep escaped from his eye at the place where it came to the bridge over a milk river.

\t Ža xabar žaq esin baqrun, babiws mač’a q’ˤim ret’urxo, tupi rok’eł c’oxxo, ašuno oƛi eč’xo.
\g 
\l Right after the boy had said that, the fathers dagger cut off his head, the rifle shot his heart and the belt cut him into halves.

\t Anunč’iza mečoƛ’ di t’o ac na yaɣˤanƛin, kidbä žawab teƛno.
\g 
\l "Where could I open a door here, in a place which has none?", answered the girl.

\t Hudayzikon xanä žeduder begirno nukarbi.
\g 
\l The next day the king sent his henchmen to them again.

\t Yeda moƛałer ik’iƛ’oräy, reže łaci rizin.
\g 
\l When he went to sleep, a big storm came up.

\t Yedu šebi ħikmatƛin, ʕažaib oqno ƛexun yeda.
\g 
\l "What a surprise!", he said surprisedly.

\t Ozer rukaynč’iza ruqˤeł, yałi ža mežuƛ’ c’axƛin”.
\g 
\l "Hide where his eyes will not see you, or else he'll pounce on you.

\t Šomoraxno ziyde puräza rečuƛt’a yizä ža yišix zown.
\g 
\l Often they locked her into the cattleshed next to the cow(s).

\t Q’arum et’un k’oƛin aɣˤuz kobora teł uqˤełno ičin.
\g 
\l Qarum jumped up, ran and hid inside the mill's granary.

\t Magalu boɣa ža aqruntow, migon bisno ħoyaɣortow kuroƛin.

\l Right after he began taking the bread out, take him and throw him into the oven!"

\t Tełerno boqno aždaħä k’ek’-bik’no ɣamas ok’zay yoɣek’no.
\g 
\l The dragon went inside and moved, and the box was pulled out from the nails.

\t Sidaquł ziru sisxoli k’et’ur rac’a šebinon k’edin bik’in.
\g 
\l One day, the fox went away alone to search something to eat for the cat.

\t Xizyo dandi zira k’et’u maħor begirno.
\g 
\l Short after, the fox sent the cat outside.

\t Nesä k’oƛin yiqirnosi, nełä harizi royn nesiq:
\g 
\l After he seized her, she begged him:

\g 
\l Without any sound, she went outside and examined if the people were asleep, and because half the people weren't sleeping [yet], she came back home, sat down a little and when she started to look again, not even in one single house she saw a light.

\t Huni yoł ganƛ’on zown uži näxzaz regin.
\g 
\l The way is going where the boy on the bull came from.

\t Hoboy nazon xexoyzaƛ’ay bok’äłƛin, aɣes rok’u ret’ux zown.
\g 
\l The bird was very afraid: "Now I will lose all of my nestlings!"

\t Nasin esnabi aderzoni žeduz halmaɣzo mecraxor bik’inosi, elo aqonibin, miƛ’bin hok’xo bˤeƛ’ez reqenyoł esun.

\l When all brothers went to their younger friend's enclosure, they found him there among the flock of sheep, seperating the lambs and the rams.

\t Bazarganbi sosigon ƛ’iri butin eƛin, debeq ela mešizałäy esirxanu, łeno waranin bižin ik’ix žek’u c’oxinč’a debełƛin esirxo.

\t Hemełaƛ’ay soder bełiqanes haq’u paraq’at zown.

\l After that, the hunter's family lived peacefully.

\t Hemeł zamanał aɣderno bayn nełaƛ’osi ɣudin rukayn, ɣʷˤadä esirno, łinaq mi nece q’ʷarid boqäsiƛin.
\g 
\l At this time, seeing its condition, a crow came to the bird and asked: "Why are you so sad?"

\t Elay izin ik’iƛ’orey, riƛu riƛix yisir sis žek’u esux.
\g 
\l He got away from there and while he is going, he finds a man plowing a field.

\t Šebi toxaw xabar bexurxoƛin, yisä yedu gulu łäłer k’oƛirno.
\g 
\l "What a weak story!", he [said and] made his horse run into the water.

\t Nełaƛ bazaryay risno där hič’č’a rigu šebin rayärux di yik’a yołƛin”.
\g 
\l I will go to the one who brings me the best thing from the market."

\t Ha howži riysi där žaƛin, - esin yisägon yisirtow raqru łinałayn.

\l "Well, I understood this now", he told about what had happened to him.

\t Xanä eƛin, di äƛiru łˤono hunar mi boynäy, debex di kid yegiranƛin.
\g 
\l The king said: "If you fulfill the three talents I tell you, I will marry my daughter off to you.

\t Xediw yałru ɣˤutkaɣorno yik’in, nesiqorno eƛin yiła, di debi baru Bilq’isdi yołƛin.
\g 
\l She went to the house where the husband was and said to him: "I am your wife Bilqisdi."

\t Sisxoli idu yičin Umukuser č’alʕizi roqxo zown.

\l Umukus, who was sitting at home lonely, was bored of this.

\t Sida quł yeda dawlaƛ’ Huläɣor ik’a ħadur oqxo.
\g 
\l One day he prepared to go to Georgia for hunting.

\g 
\l It turns out I became a lucky shepherd.", he said to himself, because he didn't saw his wife combing the wool that stuck in the honey.

\t ʕOƛno äƛiru kawun serun ezunosi, bełiqaner azbarya teł sis bercinaw kid yesun.
\g 
\l When he had unlocked the seventh gate and looked inside, he found a beautiful girl inside the palace.

\t Aždaħeł adäza ixiw gibas ħon yoqno.

\l And in front of the dragon, a big mountain of sand was formed.

\l He gave the widow what was agreed upon and sent her away.

\t Goƛ’in ža boyxozo žek’uq esirnäy, nesir rig räyƛin”.

\l "When you call the one who made the wine and ask him, he will know it better."

\t Elo tełza ezu-ʕoƛ’unosi, eɣeni esiwr siskin besunanu.

\l When he took a look inside, the younger brother didn't find anyone.

\t Neła eƛni netintow ʕaƛoxay maqˤi, qunyox, yoɣxo zown.

\l Prepare us food for three days and let us go on our way," requested the children.

\t Sasaqosi xan ezu-ʕaƛ’un, nucoz q’ilima teł c’ohortow yołäƛin.
\g 
\l The next morning the king examined, if ther was a thief in the honey pot.

\t Hudu ža ša aqˤuros maħ yołäsi boqno bäsuƛin”.
\g 
\l So this is how this wine began to smell like urine."

\t Boƛƛo zaman bik’inosi, bara xediw bet’erbaqi boda ik’anix muk’ur oyn.

\l After some time has passed, the wife confessed that she went to live with her husband.

\t Sosigon sidä sidqo łeɣin izirno ʕAliqilič q’ˤidan ok’no ašuƛäyd raƛ’moƛxor cucik’no.

\l Again they grasped each other and then he lifted Aliqilich and beat him down into the earth up to the waist.

\t Yizä ɣudes sist’a bˤeƛ’es šebin rac’xot’a zown.

\l Everyday they ate one sheep, one at a time.

\g 
\l While he was going back, many thirsty people drank up that water.

\t Žedu teł iduɣor bik’inosi xizyo, besura uži raładyoz lilyoxor ayrno kurno.
\g 
\l After they went home, the fish brought him to the bank of the sea and threw him out there.

\g 
\l The boy remembered the advice the sheikh gave: "Don't go up a mountain in the afternoon!", and told his friends: "We'll take a rest here.", but they didn't want to wait, "We will go up the mountain now.", called him a coward and got on their way.

\g 
\l And there he found a girl as beautiful as a painting.

\t Ža xanzo kidber ʕuraw isałno, k’eneč’cet’a gurow yišxo zownanu.

\t Mi ʕadalä oqno, neti deber teqä raładyołäy maħor besurobi roqnoƛin?”

\l "Where you drunked, when you hear that the fish came out of the sea?"

\g 
\l He had a beautiful, grown-up daughter.

\t Ħusenä salamno teƛno, iduɣor oqno.

\l Hussein gave a greeting and went into the house.

\t Ža reƛ’izał maxšel, hunar yołäsi, saɣaw ci rik’äsi uži zown.

\l He was a boy who was known for his talent and skill at his hands.

\t Hič’č’a eženi uži balahce siħiraw zown, hudu nesiqor C’irduxƛin eƛix zown.

\g 
\l That's what I remembered.", Tsirdukh said.

\t Ik’in, neširur yeda ʕaƛ bukayza mečoƛ’or aynosi, yizzoxay gurow č’ura rukayx zownanu.
\g 
\l He went on and in the evening, when he came to a place where he could see the village, he saw only light coming from his [house].

\t Nesiq esinč’u ža kid däx yowxosi yałrułi.
\g 
\l I didn't tell him that she's the girl I am going to marry.

\t Xanä suƛƛitow žawab teƛno, däzoq riłäsi ɣˤutkun, č’ikaysgon ƛen bodinäy, yegiranƛin.

\l The king suddenly answered: "If you build a house that resembles mine and a bridge made of glass, I will send her."

\t Ik’in, ik’in ža sidaɣ kikxor ayn.
\g 
\l He went and went and came to a spring.

\t Xizyo neła mi ʕazart’a ʕuruš yiqixozo mečoƛ’or ayärƛin.
\g 
\l Then it will bring you to the place where you get thousand rubles."

\t K’uruč’ k’eč’ ɣudi rocu, buq bay.

\l Kuruch, pearl; day, become clean; sun, come.

\t Q’ˤanon kedonyabi sida sidqo rak’ruz ruk’yo, kodin bitin łaymoƛ’äyn bik’in Ismaʕilno, ʕArabuzanno guluƛ’ay bˤoƛ’un.
\g 
\l From the roar of hitting the two sledgehammers against one another, both Ismail and Arabuzan fainted, lost consciousness and fell of their horses.

\t Tawadä yisir žawab teƛno, där siskin šebin roqäsianu.
\g 
\l Tavadi answered him: "Nothing has happened to me.

\t Mečoz č’imä bišan eqerno, C’iɣruk’ esnazał xizay ik’in.
\g 
\l Tsighruk put the food into a corner of the field and went behind his brothers.

\t Žedu c’aq’tow c’aq’ miskinłiƛ’ zownƛax.
\g 
\l They lived in much, much poverty.

\t Ay, ža yegirƛin, et’un c’oxno ičin uži.
\g 
\l "No, let her do it!", he insisted without accepting a compromise.

\t Kidbez babiya eƛin, hič’č’a adäz mi däder kidno esirno aynositow, nełas ixtiyar di dowqor neƛäsi yoł.
\g 
\l The girl's father said: "At the very beginning, after you came to me to ask for my daughter, I gave you its permission.

\t Nasin esnabi ʕuraw ɣˤaɣˤu rizin, elas esiw aħozis bara saɣ oysƛin.
\g 
\l All the sisters were very happy: "Our brother was cured by the shepherd's wife!"

\g 
\l When the boy's mother, saying "I will pick this flower", went to the bank of the sea and bowed down, the eldest sister pushed her into the sea, took the boy and went to the younger sister's home.

\t Žedus xabarno teqno žeduł xizay iłetow c’odorawni esiwn ik’in.
\g 
\l Having heard their talking, the clever brother went behind them likewise.

\t Ayn yeda sidaɣ bˤeliz ciqłer.
\g 
\l He came to a poplar forest.

\t Kaƛ’iƛin, žawab teƛno nesä.
\g 
\l "I can.", he answered.

\t Sida baħarčä q’ˤanon xexbi rexurno, c’aq’ cimyor izäsi zows žaƛin”.
\g 
\l A brave young man has killed his two children, he got very furious."

\g 
\l So there, I took my beloved you and I came."

\t Dey eniw yoł ža yegir tełxorƛin, kidbä nukarqor eƛin.

\l "It is my mother, let her inside!", said the girl to the henchmen.

\t Sida quł elor bišanixƛin xanno, nesisgon wazirbin bayn.
\g 
\l One day, the king and his vizier came there in order to eat.

\t Nełał xizay k’oƛin Bac’ali ik’iƛ’oräy, boc’i imxa tełxor boxin.
\g 
\l While Batsali was running behind him, the wolf fled into a cave.

\l "Slaughter the red heifer, and don't give your man anything else to eat until only the head and the legs remain; and tomorrow night, let your husband eat all the meat.

\t Šebičo di rodan, narčo k’oƛanƛin.

\t ʕAliqilič yołi ɣudes neširuxay babiwz šudaƛ’ort’a ik’ix sasaqor elo ɣudin qˤaširno iduɣort’a nexxo zown.
\g 
\l Aliqilich went to his father's grave every evening, spent the time there until the morning began, and went back home.

\t Raładyoł boƛor gama baynosi, nesi žek’atown ža ɣˤanabi ozƛ’o yisa oqno.
\g 
\l When the boat came to the middle of the sea, that man began to mock at the woman.

\t Xizyogon kid esirno bik’inosi, xanä kid yegiranix inkartow bodin.
\g 
\l Then they went to ask the girl, but the king rejected giving off his daughter for marriage.

\t Ik’ix, ik’ix yeda uži sidaɣ ciqqor ayn.
\g 
\l Going and going, the boy came to some forest.

\t Eženi žek’a nesiqor eƛin, he, dey uži, sistow sis yałru miƛ’in bexays mi, idu ƛexun zawruni at’es magalun bodis, howži hudu šebi roda rok’ƛ’o yoł debezƛin.
\g 
\l The old man said to him: "Hey, my son, you slaughtered the one and only ram; and you made bread from the wheat that remained in your home; so what are you planning to do now?"

\t Kid yaq’ˤiłnosi, ʕuraw ʕoloqbi bayx zown žan esirno, amma eniw razi yoqxo zownanu ža sidxokin yegiranix.
\g 
\l When the girl was grown up, many boys were coming and asked for her hand, but the mother was not content about sending her to any of them.

\t Sasaqosi yizi łiboƛ’ biza begirnosi, xanes uži kidbez ozär ezunč’eyn izin, xanes kid q’ˤida caƛin.
\g 
\l The next morning when they were let into the wrestling fight, the prince didn't look into the girl's eyes and threw the princess down.

\t Šebi roqno, ziruƛin?” - esirno zeyä.
\g 
\l "What happened, fox?", asked the bear.

\t Hemełƛ’az nełas reƛ ɣˤʷays maħ yołäsi roqno räsuƛin”.
\g 
\l This might be why its meat smells like dog.

\t Siħirawni ʕUmarqiličä łˤoran užiqay quluqno biqa betin, ža xabar nazonoqno sida sidqay bałgo esin.
\g 
\l The cunning Umarqilich wanted to get help from the three sons and told each of them the story secretly.

\t Sosi mi däq rukar, didur elo tełäy ža boɣxosi, xizyo din deber kumak bodanƛin, Ħusenän eƛin.
\g 
\l "First you show me how to take it out of there, afterwards I will help you too.", Hussein said.

\t Šebi retinƛin, raładyołäy maħor boƛixno k’oƛin nesä xʷasar bodin zawruni besuro.
\g 
\l "What do you want?" said the fish that he had saved, after appearing out of the sea.

\t Yisä ħukmu bodin, igorno ik’in salam teƛno bäsrur, di kumak bodanƛin.
\g 
\l He made a decision: "I will go into the vicinity and greet them, and I will help those who answer my greeting."

\g 
\l One day, when they were gathered again, the king threw a coin up and said: "Play, copper coin, you will not become anything anyway!"

\t Aždaħ maħor boqnosi, resunanu sabani.
\g 
\l When the dragon went outside, he didn't find the blanket.

\t Roƛxo mežiƛ’ yałzay, nesä užizaqor eƛin, di exunosi meži buq bätuzaɣor taraw bełiƛ’ bäk’inƛin.
\g 
\l While he was in his bed being sick, he said to his sons: "When I have died, you cannot go hunting anywhere besides in the west!"

\t Xizyo Beqes ʕUneyzat bero beciranix yoqno.
\g 
\l Then Sun's Uneyzat began to melt the ice.

\t Babiya qˤaƛin, bˤałay ditow k’edan, enda gulu biqira horo miƛin.
\g 
\l The father shouted: "I'll search the dagger, you come here to hold the horse!"

\t Esnabi razi boqnosi, hudayzikotow yedu žedur baruzał xizay maħor yoqno.
\g 
\l After the brothers agreed, she went outside the next day to look for wives for them.

\t Hič’č’a adäza yiłader gamiƛ’osini žek’u ayn.
\g 
\l At first came the sailor to her.

\t Yesunosi adäza hečk’er izin ičäsi ʕoloqan uži yołƛax.
\g 
\l After he found her, there was a young boy standing upright before her.

\t Hudunon yiza raq’u harizi roda biħuzaƛ’, ʕAliqiličä beže barkalan teƛno žeduqor eƛin:
\g 
\l Nevertheless, when they began to beg him very much, Aliqilich thanked them alot and said to them:

\t Meži nełaƛ’ ħayran baqno:
\g 
\l "Don't be astonished about this:

\t ʕEziyaw bišnosi, roč’iw łin ħaƛun halmaɣbi elaygon bitor hunix boqno.
\g 
\l After they had eaten much, the friends drank cold water and set out from there.

\t Howlotow babiw hemece ƛ’iri utin žaƛ’ šida mi ža eƛä, šebi deber moƛał rukayx zowäƛin.
\g 
\l Then the father replied to the son: "Why do you say this, what did you see in your dream?"

\t Boƛƛo baq’ˤu zaman bik’izaƛ’ortow, neła ħukmatyos xan hemesitow doxturder ayn, roƛnoxuni nesä nesis užin ayrno.
\g 
\l It took little time and khan of that country came to the doctor with his sick son.

\t ʕUƛ’iyä miƛin, ceyä yisiq esirno.
\g 
\l "Where you afraid?", asked him the eagle.

\t Močin kosin łiyn idur raynosi, zeyä q’ut’un bisno esirno:
\g 
\l And after they finished gathering the crop and went home, the bear took the jug and asked:

\t Ɣarabaš oc’ira minutya kʷat’izin yoqno yayn.
\g 
\l The servant came ten minutes late.

\t Šebigon ela royłin yisä ɣˤaɣˤno äči.
\g 
\l Whatever we do to him, he will endure it.

\t Zamanałäy yeda sida xander ħalt’in esirno aynosi, nesä indowrizas aħołun egirno.
\g 
\l After some time, he came to ask for work at the king's, and that one let him work as a turkey herder.

\t Oc’ira łera ɣudƛ’or Alimaħama bˤeƛ’ rok’ek’no, dicegon isin, zigolun yegirłin bˤuƛ’a moči anuzaɣor.
\g 
\l After fifteen days Alimagomed had removed the sheep to a place where they didn't have to be afraid, no matter how much snow and hail was coming.

\t Di cirabi esirnosi, žeda eluƛ’ ci sadaq’a yołƛin maxsaryoƛ’ din isno eƛisƛin, bełiqanä žawab teƛno.
\g 
\l "When I asked for the names, they said: 'Our name is Alms' and were kidding me." answered the hunter.

\t Gulukin bizanix zaħmataw qalamzo ƛ’ˤuƛ’or, ʕomoybigon nay žeduq elo ƛ’irir rizix.
\g 
\l But it's difficult for a horse to get up the fortress' roof, but the donkeys they could get on it.

\t Žek’u iziłxanuzo sida osiw ezä tełno yičirno, q’ˤida mečoƛ’ortown yegirinč’ey ža xanä kikix zown.
\g 
\l The king forced her to live inside a high fortress that was impossible for people to get into, and he fed her without letting her come to any lower places,

\t Taliħ boqno debi xizay yäk’iru,
\g 
\l That you went behind [me] became your luck,

\t Tungiƛ’ay yok’äłru kidno, esiwx ʕiyayx iduɣor yik’in.
\g 
\l And the girl who was going away from the jug went home crying for her brother.

\t K’oxäƛirugon ʕomoy ħoʕƛinosi, nesä eƛin, žigoƛ’ay dey ruħ boɣno ašuƛäyr baysƛin.
\g 
\l When the donkey shouted a second time, he said: "Now my soul has been taken away and it has come up to my waist."

\t Deber sis aɣi bäsu, were mi nełas tupi caƛin, nełaz tupi caƛinäy, deber žuk roqa yołƛin.
\g 
\l You will find a bird, well, don't shoot it with your rifle, if you shoot it with the rifle, it is going to be bad for you."

\t Kikxor aynosi, łin ħaƛun, Ħusen muši begira q’ˤida ičin.
\g 
\l After Hussein came to the spring, he drank the water and sat down to take a breath.

\t Zira ža neła nełde sadaq iduɣor bižin.
\g 
\l The fox took him with him to his own home.

\t Rok’un roč’iłno, xizor butin nexƛ’oräy, yizi žedu esnazader bayn.
\g 
\l They lost all their hope, and while they were coming back, they ran into those siblings.

\t Xizyo neła ħumukulä ža sida ħonƛ’or ayrno.
\g 
\l Afterwards that camel brought him onto a mountain.
