\l They were surprised and talked among each other: "Isn't there everything possible on the table, but he nevertheless can't let his hand to any of it?"

\t Sis nełarno kurno siskin där ƛexandaƛin, aɣzo rok’ƛ’orno rayn, dicego rok’er zaħmat roqłin, zirur sis xexoy kurno.

\l "Throwing one down, there will still remain one for me.", thought the bird and although it was difficult, it threw one nestling to the fox.

\t T’ok’ow bäxuru onočas xexoycekin elay iziłno anu.

\l "I see something like smoke.", said the hunter.

\t Bik’in ečrut’ani xalq’in łˤebozałäyn oɣno ža uži iduɣor own.

\l I wanted to see my mother and my brothers."

\l "I will give all your things back to you, if you give me back my magic wand," answered the boy them.

\t Äzuru yisir ciqez raʕalłix yałruni sida ixiw ɣunoq soder bizix aždaħ-bikori bukayn.
\g 
\l Looking around, he saw a dragon-snake climbing a tree that was standing at the edge of the forest.

\t Dey xediw nexxoƛin, yiła yeda sida yeže ɣamasya tełxor uqˤno.
\g 
\l "My husband is coming!", she [said and] hid him inside a large box.

\l Don't destroy the friendship that is between you because of us!

\g 
\l Tsirdukh and his brothers left her crying and went away from there.

\t Ciqqay qacan t’it’in, ruk’un rayrno esnabi bayn.

\l After they all went outside, the henchman who got the small mat and the small bread afterwards told him: "We were walking for a week and this boy with the house even prettier than yours gave us the meat that we didn't get; they even might be your children."

\t Žoyä ɣˤutku rodixƛin eženi žek’uqno esin meɣyoqor eƛin, xanes riłe ɣˤutkun, č’ikays ƛen boqoƛƛin.

\t ʕAƛaza ec’no xabar šebiƛin yisä esirnosi, sida maduhalä esin, xanez yeɣeni kidbeƛäy bitor sidä sis esnabi bexursiƛin.

\g 
\l When the king threw the copper coin upward and said his phrase, Kusa threw up the golden coin up and said: "Play, golden coin, there is nothing in the world that you couldn't become!"

\t Bara yisir ičin močitown xecinč’izaƛ’, xizyo yisä eƛin, ža esinäy, di äxuƛin.

\g 
\l "So you have fulfilled my wish?", [said] the fox[,] got up from there, went to the king's daughter and told her that the house and the fortune all belong to the dog and that he is just a miller.

\t Howła imadał hič’č’a ixiw šebi yoł: isä, ceyä, t’ekayä, aħoyä, ziruyä, q’orol ɣˤanabiyä?

\l Who is the biggest one in this tale: The bull, the eagle, the goat, the shepherd, the fox or the widow?

\t Aždaħes yaqru nˤoƛun łacqo yižirno, nełas zawru šinaw xazina mesedno bižin, Baxumesedun guluƛ’ zowrno Kidiro Žabulawder ik’in.

\l He let the wind carry away ashes of the dragon, took all the gold from its treasures, seated Bakhumesed on a horse, and went to Jabulaw in Kidero.

\t Bayn zira, mušin pˤaƛun, noci užiƛ’or butirno.

\t Kʷaxatow bełiqanä barun yown, ƛˤeb ħišiłzaƛ’or žedur q’ˤuƛas q’ˤano uži odin.

\l Soon the hunter married a wife, and before a year was over, two twin boys were born to them.

\t Bilq’isdä nesiqor eƛin, mi Q’urʔan yaqino, där teqa retin didur mi ža t’et’erxoƛin.

\l "From now on, don't do such things anymore!", Bilqisdi put her hands onto his eyes, gave him back his eyelight and sent him outside.

\t Eženi esiya eƛin:

\l The eldest brother said:

\l "Now it's time to do the threshing.", Alimagomed thought and went into the forest to bring wood for building the yoke for the bulls.

\t Nełaq mi rasgi q’ʷarid yaqnoƛin, žoyä nełas rok’u čučzi royn.
\g 
\l "Don't be sad at all about it!", he calmed her down.

\t Hunix bik’iƛ’orey, žedur ħumukulis ruɣu resun.

\l He asked the guest: "Why is this woman yelling and crying?"

\t K’ak’aryar baynosi yisä eƛin, howt’äy bitor di ik’äłinč’iƛin.
\g 
\l When they came to a narrow point, he said: "I cannot go on from here."

\t Xanes kid c’unzi yodanix sis oz bayn, xizay biłetow sisgon bayn.
\g 
\l In order to protect the king's daughter, an army came, and behind it another similar army came.

\t Roqnäy däł xizay rexadanix sadaq’ałer ħonƛ’äy bˤeƛ’ rowan ik’an, elazay aynosi, debeq žan esanƛin.
\g 
\l "In that case, I will go and bring the sheep from the mountain for slaughtering them for alms behind me(?), and when I come back here, I will tell it to you."

\t Nesis hut’-mˤalay ƛ’er bisäsi bukayzaƛ’ hunixoza esirno, šebi deber roqnoƛin.

\l When they saw the color vanishing from his face, the travellers asked: "What happened to you?"

\t Ceyä yisir bigu gulu teƛno.
\g 
\l The eagle gave him a good horse.

\t Hemece rigu ɣˤutkun ričin, łinaq mi q’ʷarid oqxoƛin, esirno eženä.
\g 
\l "That is such a pretty house, what are you so sad about?", asked the old one.

\t Yedan ʕabdal yołƛin, bazarganbi elaygon bitor bik’in.
\g 
\l "He is an idiot as well," [said] the merchants [and] went away from there.

\t Bełiqanä esirno nełaq, mi nesis kidä, baruyä yaqƛin.
\g 
\l The hunter asked her: "Are you his daughter or his wife?"

\t Nełƛ’ay soder ža ɣˤanabi xedyoz zulmuqayn yok’ełno, Allahzo ašunoz kumakyoƛaza raħatyoƛ’ zown.
\g 
\l After that, the woman got repose from her husband's tyranny and his beatings with the help of the rainbow.

\t Yeženi esiya žawab teƛno:

\l The eldest sister answered:

\t Esin šebi, xecin šebi sida beɣe ʕaƛa res anusi, baru yowace oqäsi ʕoloqanaw uži zown.

\l What is to be said, what is to be left out -- there lived a young boy, without the necessary subsistence, being in the right age to marry a woman.

\t Xanä wazirzaqor amru bodin, ʕAt’id xexłiƛ’ däder ayroƛin.

\l The father led her to a place far away in the forest, likewise dug a hole and built a roof of moss ontop, left her there and returned.

\t Moƛaxay žan č’arik’no, nesä eƛin, di malaik yoł, asatow maharno erno, mi yowanix nexäsi t’aɣor, neširu di dowde puħo keca ayƛin.

\t Esnazaq sipat esin łiynosi nesi žek’a eƛin:

\t Q’ˤano äƛirugon nesä žaqay ɣˤurušno yisno, mi qˤišodäy soder ħon xäcinƛin, ʕaq’lun bodin.
\g 
\l For the second time he took a ruble from the boy and gave him the advice: "Don't go up the mountain after it got dark!"

\t Xizyo žedagon ža ižin xaner teƛno.
\g 
\l Afterwards they brought and gave him to the king.

\l The boy became a pigeon again, and the girl opened the window and let it out.

\t Mamalay ɣudes ciqaɣor qaciƛ’or bik’ix zown, onoču iduza beynoyx, iduzasi royx bičix zown.

\l Every day the rooster went into the forest for firewood, and the hen was at home doing the housework.

\l And when you go further from there, you will find a man with holy water in his hands, but he won't drink it.

\l Afterwards, the father sold his boy off to the merchants, as he said.

\t Hoboygon xan žedu raqˤanix žek’u iqinč’ey ƛexun.

\l But now the king didn't have anyone to sew them.

\l One day in the evening the khan left his elder son in the garden to find out who comes and steals the apples.

\t Babiwn razi oqno nełaƛ’, bełiqus uži uqˤłanix egirno.

\l And Tsirdukh gave the same answer as before.

\l In the morning he chased them onto a mountain, towards the evening they came back home by themselves.

\l Having eaten their food, the three brothers went outside without having talked to Kusa.

\t Xizyo Ħon-Bahadurä babiwq nesir yukayru moƛałäy esin, howža moƛał yukayru kidbeł xizay ik’a retinƛin.
\g 
\l Then Mountain~Hero told his father about the dream he had seen: "I want to go after the girl that I had seen in that dream."

\t Ža ħalt’i mežur di buytown badinč’iƛin, uži razi oqnoanu.
\g 
\l "That work I won't do for you for free.", the boy disagreed.

\t Mi där madaħ esus yołi exura zows.
\g 
\l Had I found you outside, I would have killed you.

\t T’ok’ow roda šebinon koƛ’inč’ey, hisno, hiƛun, ʕoƛ’no, nucosgon bankan bisno, yedu kid beqaɣor yoqno.
\g 
\l Not knowing what to do anymore, the girl took the wool, the comb, the spindle and a jar of honey and went into the sun.

\t Elo zawru miƛ’es c’ik’iw reƛ k’et’ur ƛexun.
\g 
\l So the ram's entire meat, which was there, remained for the cat.

\t Sis zown beže, oc’ira łˤora kilometra bexora is.
\g 
\l There was a 13 kilometer long ox.

\t T’akanyar bayru mesedno ħiƛ’oqax butirno čantan eqerno, łˤonon besuron bižin uži iduɣor ik’in.
\g 
\l The boy gathered the gold that came int the glass into a handkerchief, put it inside his pocket and carried the three fish home.

\t Nesis ʕomoy bičinč’ey ħoʕƛix zown.
\g 
\l His donkey was shouting without stopping.

\t ʕOƛno ħonno, ʕoƛno iħun xecin ik’inosi, sida ʕaƛar ayn.

\l After he walked past seven mountains and seven rivers, he came into a village.

\g 
\l After he had read the letter, Razhbadin wondered in surprise: "What happened to me?"

\g 
\l Then the house-serf came, lead her to the king, and she told [him] of her wish: "By God, I have come to ask out the kings daughter to marry my son."

\t Hudu t’ok’ow šebi rodanƛin, užin ižin babiw iduɣor ik’ix zown.
\g 
\l "So what more shall I do?", the father [said and] lead the boy home.

\t Elo yisir siskin ukayza žek’utow esun anu.

\l There he didn't find any person, wherever he looked.

\t Idurno yik’in užin č’arik’no eniya eƛin, eliz mada łuƛa ixiw ɣˤutku rodinƛin.

\l The mother went home, woke up the boy and said: "Someone built a big house outside of ours."

\t Meži łˤonon esnabin yoł, mežułäy sider gurow di yuyn yäqinč’i.
\g 
\l "You are three brothers and I won't get to any of you except for one.

\l But the tale is more valuable than the silver and remains for me to tell you.

\l That sheep was brought from the mountain, slaughtered and when he let the king eat its meat, he got cured.

\t Šebintow roda koƛ’inč’ey kid ƛexunosi, nełder zey bayn.
\g 
\l When - not knowing what to do - the girl was remaining there, a bear came to her.

\l One day, while being in the forest, and old man came to the husband and asked him: "What happened to you, why are you so sad?"

\t Mi äƛiruxor rodanƛin, eniwr rožin teƛno, uži ʕaƛay maħor hunix oqno.
\g 
\l The son gave his mother his word: "I'll do what you said!", and went on his way out of the village.

\t Xizyogon hemedurtow yeženi esiya ža uži c’enno ʕiyayrno.
\g 
\l Then the eldest sister pinched the boy again and made him cry.

\t Elaɣor bik’iƛ’oräy, zirude dandir ixiw bˤeƛ’es reqenno, žedał tełgon bik’ix ixiw ɣˤʷayn keze boqno.

\l When they went there, the fox met a big flock of sheep and a large dog walking among them.

\t Hunix mekʷa c’oxnosi, žeda sosi iguni halmaɣes bišʷa rac’no łiyrno.
\g 
\l When they became hungry on their way, the first ate up the good friend's food.

\g 
\l "I'm coming myself!", said the mother.

\t Eženi esiya beɣet’ani esnazaqor eƛin:

\l The eldest brother said to his younger brothers:

\t Yizi bukayrun, aždaħä zudäy roɣno ixiw riris ɣun yiził adäzar rayrno kurno.

\l When he saw them, the dragon tore out an alder tree from its roots and threw it before them.

\t Yisiq qu ƛˤeb yaynosi, riynč’ey reƛił ƛuza riqin.
\g 
\l When he became twenty years old, he found bones in his meat.

\t Howłaƛ’ dey emadun łiys, keca zamanno bays.
\g 
\l With that my story ends, now sleeping time has come.

\t Nesiz kumakyoƛ’aza di elo č’agu ƛexus exurxo zawru.

\l They wanted to kill me, but thanks to his help I stayed alive there.

\t Hemeła maqˤizo ʕaƛasi där moƛał yukayru mesedyos nak’ila yałruni kid yiqinč’inäy di anƛ’imoq’az äxuƛin.”

\t Dey di roɣno ozuri rac’xo, debi min rac’oƛin” - žawab teƛno zira.

\l "I eat the eye I have removed, eat yours too!", answered the fox.

\t Łoxäƛirugon xanä ʕaq’lus xalq’i sadaqor butirnosi, Kusa mesedyos ʕabasin yižin elor ik’in.

\l When the king gathered his advisors for the third time, Kusa carried a golden coin with himself.

\l The Georgians were saying: "We will torture him, kill him and then throw him away!"

\g 
\l Father and daughter came out to find out where the boy had hidden.

\g 
\l So I knew that it has a left eye that is blind."

\t Uži xabar esa oqno, di ʕaƛa zows.
\g 
\l The boy began to tell a story: "I was in a village.

\t K’edin esurno yizä Ražbadin žeduz odoman Tawadider ižin.
\g 
\l They searched and found Razhbadin, and lead him to their leader Tavadi.

\t Xizyogon žoyä eƛin kidbeqor:
\g 
\l Then the boy said to the girl:

\t K’eneč’ k’eč’ ɣudi rocu.

\l All's well that ends well.

\t Žan bitor yiq’ˤirno waħaz egin ik’inosi, deber elo ixiw gondu yukay, elogon tełxor oqnosi, q’ˤida yičäsi eniw yäsu.

\l After you have moved it aside and went below it, you will see a big hole, and inside you will see your mother sitting there.

\t Ža hunix oqnosi xalq’imo eč’erxo zown, äk’ino elaɣor min ok’äk’ƛin.

\l When he got on his way, the people were stopping him: "Don't go here, you will be stolen as well!"

\l "What is your wish?

\t Horo eli sidqo sis biłaniƛäyn, dey rok’u riq’ˤaniƛäyn, łˤonon debi užibi däz žaz mečʷa bexuranix dadäɣor begirnäy där räti.

\l So that we resemble one another and that you approach my heart, I'd love if you could send your three sons to me so I could kill them instead of my son."

\t Žedu sadaq ričix zown.
\g 
\l They lived together.

\t Aħos nesix rok’un rexun, ža icin zawruni ročyabi reč’-t’it’in roɣno.

\l The shepherd had deep sympathy for him, and cut off the ropes that restrained him.

\l In places outside, he was very cautious.

\t Elay ža maħor łi roƛäk’rur, žamaʕatyo ʕaƛos boƛƛik’u ric’q’i neƛxoƛax.
\g 
\l They say that the assembly of the village would give half their wealth in order to get the water out there.

\t Neła ža imyoq yicin zawruni ɣˤanabi elar yutirxo, t’ar yutirxo esayn q’ˤimaku yiłe yodin yegirno.

\l She washed the woman who was tied to the pole, turning her hither and thither, and let her look like a grown-up.

\t Nedur resunäyƛin, - eƛin kidbä, - meži łˤoran esnaza sidä sidƛ’ay bežin šebin riszaƛ’, mežatow xal bodo di łux yik’a yayƛin”.

\l "If that is so", said the girl, "you three brothers found such things, one better than the other, now figure out: to whom I shall go?

\t Sasiłzaƛ’or xan idurno ik’inanu, č’uħaraw šeƛ’un šeƛ’unanu.
\g 
\l Until it got dark, the king neither went home nor put on gorgeous clothing.

\t Hemełƛ’o elo akiłäza łäs bic’äsi tungin bižin Ražbadinxo esäruni kid yik’äsi zown.

\l The girl that Razhbadin asked [= his fiancée] carried a copper jug filled with water and was going to a window up there.

\g 
\l The other one turned into a hen and began to eat the wheat.

\l After having gone a long distance, he found a woman combing wool.

\g 
\l He said, " I am a doctor known in the world."

\l The wife knew that today the husband would die.

\l The woman who had gone looking returned and said: "It has been three months since the king's daughter has conceived her child."

\t Ražbadinä reƛ’ibin risno, Tawadisno nesiz halmaɣzasno hunin regirno, xizor iduɣor utin.
\g 
\l Razhbadin took the hands of Tavadi and his friends, sent them on their way and returned home.

\t Neła quł sasaqozoxgon ɣurox žade sadaq babiwn ik’in.
\g 
\l The next day in the early morning, the father went together with the boy to pasture the cows.

\t Ceyä eƛin, mi di bexarno, xizyo di nagon boqłin debez rigzar bäsu, mežustow kici yoł, radiru rigłi šuƛ’ixosi anuƛin.

\l The eagle said: "Don't kill me! I'll will be a help for you somewhere; you have a proverb: 'A done good is not forgotten'."

\t Ža debeq äsirus haqu azirodoƛ, mi där łˤora ɣudi ʕeze roqace biša eroƛin, esiwqorno eƛin, išno-utin kecno yeda.
\g 
\l "May the mouth of the one who told you that freeze over! Prepare me food enough for three days!", he said, ate and slept.

\t Nesis łˤono kid zown.
\g 
\l He had three daughters.

\t Žan risno iduɣor ik’iƛ’orey, xizayn bayn neł bikorä esirno, deber ža ħiƛ’oqu reynoyrakin koƛ’ixosi yołäƛin.

\t Idur ayzaƛ’or sidä ħaƛun, sidä ħaƛun ža łi nesiqayn hemedurtow łiyrno.
\g 
\l When he went home, someone wanted to drink and another one wanted to drink, so this water was empty as well for him.

\t Qacisni gulu ɣˤʷayƛ’orno butin, k’oƛin bik’in xanes kid xanno.
\g 
\l The wooden horse turned into a dog, ran and bit the king's daughter.

\t Yeɣeni kidbeq esirnosi yołi, deber rätiru zamanał mi äƛiru šebin roda ħaduraw di yołƛin, eniwqor eƛin.
\g 
\l When she asked the youngest daughter, she said to her mother: "I'm ready to do whatever you say, whenever you want."

\t Hoboy q’orolaz užä yizi baƛ’ärułi riynosi, ʕoƛiran esnaza q’ut’i bodin ža exuranixƛin.
\g 
\l Now, after the seven brothers knew that the widow's son had cheated them, they agreed to kill him.

\t Debeƛ’no gurħizi oqno bexurƛ’oräysi mi di xʷasar boysƛin, di nełqor eƛis.
\g 
\l 'I felt sorry for you and rescued you from getting killed', I said to it.

\g 
\l Then the older brother said: "Before two die, it's better if [just] one dies.

\t Rigu bišan rodin, sida quł neširu babiya Ismaʕil iduɣor goƛ’in.
\g 
\l The father prepared good food and one day in the evening he invited Ismail into his house.

\t Šida mi elo nece mixƛ’or yičäƛin, xanes kid c’ok’inayn nełqor.
\g 
\l "Why did it take you so much time?", the princess scolded her.

\t Elay Ražbadin Tawadiƛ’ ƛ’irir ik’in, nesiqor c’ok’inayn, yedu šebi šebin mi där rodä bertenyołerno goƛ’inƛin.

\l From there, Razhbadin went up to Tavadi and scolded him: "What is that thing you did to me, inviting me to a marriage?!"

\t Bayn yizirabi ƛirbałix sid žek’ude idur.
\g 
\l Then came home to a man as guests.

\t T’eker šebi eƛakin riyn anu nełaz šilazaƛ’ roqxosi šebin.

\l The goat didn't even notice what happened on its horns.

\g 
\l While he went on his way, that thin horse said to him: "While the dragon sleeps, the sun goes up, and after he gets up a shadow appears on the meadow, there around it the youngs are playing.

\t Užir łinasnotow čaran bexun, ži ik’ix di dunyalqoƛin, eƛin oqno ik’in elay sida baydanƛ’or ayn.
\g 
\l Now that all the possibilities are gone for the boy, he said "I shall wander through the world now", and began to go away until he came to a field.

\t Ža ɣudes ciqaɣort’a ik’ix Allahqo harizi oqxo zown: däłäy žek’ułersi žek’u odoƛin.
\g 
\l Every day, he went into the forest and asked God: Make me a respectable man.

\t Howła gulułäy ɣˤʷay bodoƛin”.
\g 
\l Make a dog out of this horse!

\t Kut’yoƛ’aza puƛ’aza nełaƛ’ nucos sik zown”.
\g 
\l On its right side there was a waterskin with honey.

\t Žan sadaq yižin uži babiwz ʕaƛaɣor ik’in.

\l The boy took her together to his father's village.

\t Nasi yołƛin, išara bodin esirno ʕArabuzanä.

\l "Which one is she?", signaled and asked Arabuzan.

\t Howži yisi ʕAliqiličä yiziqor eƛin:

\l The wife's name was Bilqisdi.

\t Mi äƛiruxor ričiƛƛin, razi oqno neł ɣˤutkos bet’erhan.
\g 
\l "May it be as you said!", agreed the master of that house.

\t Boyxosi ħalt’i łiynosi, esnabin iduɣor rik’in.

\l When they finished the work, the sisters went home.

\g 
\l Pakhrudin thought that also all of his sheep must have died.

\t ƛ’iräy reku roɣnosi, čanyas maħi roƛixno.
\g 
\l After they had taken away the manure, a goat's tail appeared.

\t Nełaz rok’ƛ’or rayn, yeda däder igu žek’u aynč’uƛin.
\g 
\l She thought: "He didn't come to me as a good man."

\t Bˤeƛägon qˤay łäƛ’or begirno.

\l And the pig sent the hare for water.

\t Elay bik’in cek’ä iħäy łäs yic’no mušno yown nexƛ’oräy, nełał xizay k’oƛin zey nexxo zown.
\g 
\l The goat kid went away from there, brought a pot filled with water from the river and when it came back, a bear was running behind it.

\t Mamalayägon, di rešonazałäy šebin rut’ix bäčiƛin, eƛin.
\g 
\l The rooster then said: "I will be collecting things out of the garbage."

\t Xizyo xanä nazon nukarzaq riyrno, c’ohor yoł t’oza sis reƛ’a anusi, meži nasin nesił xizay boq, ža meža iqira ayƛin.

\t Ža bac’run, nełłäy yałru xanes kid yoqno.
\g 
\l After she ate it, she turned back from what she was, into the princess.

\t Hemedur ƛˤebrebi rik’in nesis uži aq’ˤiłno ʕoloqan oqno, baru yowa mix bayn nesis.
\g 
\l So the years went by, his son grew up and became a young man, and the time came for him to marry.

\t Zamanaƛ’aza ža rutin rik’in eženä egirno zawruni uži äčiza puƛ’aɣor.
\g 
\l After some time it fell to the side where the old man had placed the boy.

\t Hudu neła mežur łi neƛxosi anaƛin? - esirno yisä neła q’orolaq.
\g 
\l "So he's not giving you water?", he asked the widow.

\t Elur yiłaƛ’ay mustaħiq’aw močin bäsunč’i, ži eƛnoqor ħadur roqanix zamanno bayn, howt’otow ričanƛin, žedas ħukmu boqno.

\l "We won't find a place more suitable than this one; now the time has come to prepare for the winter; we will live here." was their decision.

\t Žan eƛin hemedurtow ozƛäy gugin.

\l The boy sold his cow for the rifle and went straight to the market with the intention of selling it and buying clothes.

\t Neła eƛin nesiqor:

\l Who came here?"

\t Biš-butin bizinosi, zeyä yisiq esirno, łinał xizay, šebin retin mi maħor oqäsiƛin.

\l After the bear has eaten, he got up and asked, "What are you looking for in your trip?"

\t Mi badiru ħurmatno där ʕezen boqno ƛ’iräza k’oƛäsi yoł.
\g 
\l And your respect was enough for me, more than necessary.

\t Xizyo xanä nesä nesider goƛ’in barus esnabin, nukarbin, ža q’orolayn.

\l After that, the king invited to himself the wife's sisters, the henchmen and that widow.

\t Tełxor k’oƛin cek’i bok’äłrun, aceƛ zeys meč’no biqin.

\l She took out and brought to fall that king's armies, and finally the remaining ones fled.

\g 
\l Because it was a guest who was coming, the dragon let him fill his jug with water from the spring without saying anything.

\t Howlotow kidno xecin bełiqubi žeda žeduz hunix bik’in.
\g 
\l Leaving the girl there, the hunters went on their own way.

\l The girl's father - the king - called all doctors, gathered them around himself and said:

\t Žar čuqˤno nesi bečedawni maduhales piša yedu yałrułi.

\l "I didn't assault your goat," said the fox, "don't you see I am coming from the hajj with things for my family?"

\t Beže bertenno boyn, xanä ža kid barułun yown.
\g 
\l A big marriage was arranged and the king married that girl.

\l She found them sleeping in the shade of a tree.

\g 
\l When the girl with the ring had disappeared from the marriage, the boy lost his cheerfulness and quickly went home and to bed.

\t Igtow xan ƛ’iri utinosi, yisä roži teƛno.
\g 
\l After the king insisted so much, he gave his word.

\t Eženi esiya nesiqor eƛin:
\g 
\l The eldest brother said to him:

\t Iduɣor beza bik’inosi, Tawadir exurno gič’orabin rodin kuräsi uži esun.

\l When they went to look into the room, Tavadi found his son cut dead into pieces.

\l Ismail thought: "If I help the seven brothers, the ones they are fighting will notice what a proud man I am, but if I help them instead, the brothers will notice, what a mean man I am."

\t Howži mi ader ik’iƛin eƛin, yedu ozyoƛ’ yiħanada yoqno.

\t Posures mec nesir biyxozołäy Alimaħama łaqnokin esin anu, esinäy mi äxuƛin nesiq riyräsi roqzaƛ’ qˤayz xexoyä.

\l Alimagomed told to no one about his knowing the animals' language, because the rabbit's young had explained to him: "If you tell it, you'll die!"

\t Nesä naysinan nesiz raƛ’ma xabar begirno, c’ohor däƛ’ay ežis, di nesił q’ˤim rok’siƛin.

\g 
\l Methinks, you have stolen my camel, give it back to me!"

\t Zeyä q’ˤogedtow qˤiči kosix zown, zira sist’a ƛ’ara but’ix bičäsi zown.

\l The bear packed the harvest together in hay bales, the fox was the one who ripped out the ears one after another.

\l In Telavi there's one brother of mine, named Tavadi; before he comes here, I won't marry."

\l And all the people went "Whoa! How could one bullet hit it from the ear to the hoofs?"

\l Soon the king's daughter returned to the miller.

\t Xediw ičäsi zown žiƛbon xecin, k’oxäygon meši bodinč’inäy, bexʷadanƛin.

\l The husband remained [in his opinion]: "We'll leave it this year and if it doesn't calve again, we shall slaughter it."

\t Sis ixiw ceyn bayn ža is elay neła bok’no bižin.
\g 
\l And a big eagle came, struck this bull down and carried it away from there.

\t Nełƛ’osi ɣudbi rik’inosi, sida quł iħuz lilyox yisir bikori besun.
\g 
\l From then on the days went by, and one day he found a snake at the river bank.

\l Take away the crate that came down when you said 'Tsurun-tsaran!', let the other one down without touching it with the hand!"

\t Xanes wazir č’ariłno puħo t’akan yukaynosi, nesis cim bizin, łu yedu mesedyos t’akan t’or yayrnoƛin.

\l "Don't", he said, "believe in a short woman with her eyelashes red, her eyes green and her hair white, but keep away from her!"

\t Nesisgon łˤono uži zown.
\g 
\l He had three sons.

\t Anu där t’ok’ow łinaqazaykin ħinq’iƛin, žawab nełan teƛno.

\l And she answered: "There's no dangerous place for me anymore."

\l Then they sent the widow to play a trick on the children.

\g 
\l May all lovers come together likewise!

\t Neła qułno yisi žaq ɣuro kamin.

\g 
\l When he came to the dragon, he was making the same agreement as with Hussein with him, that if he throws a stone three times and hits him at least once, he must break him apart in the middle, if he doesn't hit him at least once, the dragon would be swallowing him.

\t Yeda hunix ik’iƛ’oräy, yisir qˤaƛu teqno, mi nesi žek’uł xizay äk’ino, nesä mi exarƛin.

\l Because he insisted so much, Tavadi told him: "Right after lifting my glass to drink on your and your soon to be married wife, my eye met this girl whom I saw going under the window and taking a jar on her back, and her beauty was intoxicating."

\t Mi dey halmaɣ esunäy, yedu kid debi mi yižo.

\t K’ox äƛiru rayäru bišadyołno besun zahru.
\g 
\l And for the second time there was poison in the food they had brought.

\t Amma nesi žoyä xanłi risnoanu.
\g 
\l But the boy didn't take up the kingship.

\t Ža bihayaw šebin yołƛin, Bilq’isdä nełaq yałru micxir ečruni žek’uqor teƛno.
\g 
\l "That's an easy thing.", said Bilqisdi and gave the old man all the money she had.

\t Kidber riyn nełaz babiwł adäza t’et’erxo zawruni užiłäy gulu baqrułi.

\l His daughter knew that the horse used to be the boy, who learned in front of her father.

\g 
\l When he chased him away from there, the span-sized man took a hair out of his moustache, tied the hunter to a pole, ate up the entire food, jumped on his rooster and rode away.

\t Wallah, etixƛin, eƛin ečruni žek’a.
\g 
\l "By God, I do!", said the old man.

\t Idur aynosigon, yexurno ža k’eneč’ žeduz ozzaq yiħoƛin.
\g 
\l "After you come home, crack the egg and smear it on their eyes."

\t ʕUraw ħayran oqno xan, neła kidbes c’odorłin ʕaq’ilłin rukayn.
\g 
\l The king became very suprised, and he saw that girl's cleverness and intelligence.

\t Žamaʕatyo ɣˤaɣˤu bizizaq nesir baq’ˤu mesedno teƛno, reže suħmatno rodin hunix egirno.

\l Because the population got happy, they gave him much gold, organized a big party and let him go on his way.

\t Hemece raładya caƛi- ok’no yisiz lagiq siskin šebin ƛexun anu.
\g 
\l The sea threw him many times, but there were no traces on his body.

\t Baq’ˤu šaharyasi ʕoloqbi boƛixno di, di ža aždaħ bexursiƛin.
\g 
\l Many young men from the city came and claimed they had killed the dragon.

\t Elaygon bitor žedu bik’inƛax, rigu hawan, bac’adaw łin, raqˤäsi bix yałzarno, žek’utow anuza mečoƛ’or baynƛax.

\t Xizaɣor, hudun nełar riyx babiya užiqay bisxot’a micxir c’idaɣor kurxosi yałrułi.
\g 
\l Nevertheless she finally found out that the father was throwing the money that the boy earned into the fire.

\t Idur baynosigon elon žeda ixiw berten bodin.
\g 
\l After they came home, they also celebrated a big wedding there.

\g 
\l "There are still fifteen days left to lead the sheep to the mountain, we don't need to hurry.", they said.

\t Neła kidno, užin rodäsi resun.
\g 
\l She had given birth to a daughter and a son.

\t Elayn izin imyoq ħobo bok’nosi, nazay eƛa biynč’ey t’as bˤoƛ’un bayn.
\g 
\l So he got up from there and kicked the pole, and out of who-knows-where a bowl fell down.

\t Sidakin kidbä nesix yik’anix roži teƛxo zownanu.
\g 
\l Not even one girl promised to marry him.

\t Neła eƛin:
\g 
\l She said:

\g 
\l The two sat down and when they had finished eating, the boy filled the glass he found in the fish's mouth with water and gave it to her to drink.

\t Sidqor sis bicin howlotow žedun xecin, q’urec’niƛ’ ƛ’iri esiws cudin erno, oqno iduɣor žan ik’in.
\g 
\l He tied them one on one and left them there, then he put his brother's corpse onto the mule and began to go home.

\t Mi däƛ’ay ežen yoł, däzoƛ’aygon rigu tupin yoł debeq, mitow č’aq’ˤirno nesir bižoƛin eƛin, teƛno anu užä ža aɣi xanez nukarqor.
\g 
\l "You are older than me and also you have a rifle better than mine, kill one yourself and carry it to him!" the boy said and didn't give the bird to the king's henchman.

\t Ɣˤutkazoni imyoq ħobon bok’no rok’er rätiru šebin harizi roynäy roqxosi yołƛin.
\g 
\l "If you kick a pole in the house and ask for what your heart desires, it will become true."

\t Hunix dandir c’axru ahlimo esirzaƛ’, žedur teƛxo užä łäs bic’äsi q’ut’u łiyrno.
\g 
\l Because on the way, people whom he met on the way, asked him, the boy was giving them [water] and the jug filled with water was finished.

\t Nesä reƛ’a regirƛ’oräy, aɣi boxin.
\g 
\l When he opened his hand, the bird flew away.

\g 
\l The youngest brother said:

\t Łˤonon žedu rukaynosi, yeɣeni kid yezun ƛexun, yizigon nazay t’or keze roqäƛin.
\g 
\l When the young girl saw the three of them, it remained looking [surprised] and asked, where they had come from.

\t Xizyo yizä ža iduɣorno own esirno nesiq, didur šebi roqno mi t’or keze oqäƛin.
\g 
\l Then they let him into the house and asked him what had happened and how he came here.

\t Eƛa šebinon koƛ’inč’ey haqa ogun heresi mec esixosini ƛexasi yałzay, buyxor mec esixosini ħalarno oƛixno eƛin:
\g 
\l While the liar stood there with an open mouth not knowing what to say, and the one who always said the truth came to help and said:

\t Šet’urno bezu-bˤoƛ’un, neła nasin č’urambi rukayxosi močibi äsiruxorgon, nesä ok’bi paqˤƛirxo ik’ix zown.
\g 
\l He [Tsighruk] struck in nails to where he [the dragon], looking around and seeing all the light, told.

\g 
\l Right from the beginning he started to behave like in the house of his parents; how much his wife would say, he neither hacked firewood, nor did he go and bring water, nor did he do look for or did any other housework.

\t Xanä žedu t’umbi łˤora ɣudi quqan xecin rišerƛ’oräy, aqugani bišno łiyace gulučini t’umi šet’u butix bičin.
\g 
\l The king left those pigeons hungry for three days, and when he fed them, the male one turned around until the female one had finished eating.

\t Hudayƛ’aygon maduhalłiqozoni xanä begirno q’ˤano gulu bayrno nasi yizałäy ʕoloqanaw, nasi ečru yałru bat’a boda koƛ’inč’inäy, di dowde dandir ƛˤori boda yołƛin.
\g 
\l On the next day, the neighboring king had two horses be brought to him, [saying:] "If you don't know how to find out which of them is young and which is old, I will make war on you!"

\t Xizyo žoyä eƛin, eni, eli beynodäsi boqzaƛ’, elur boƛik’ut’a ħak’o keze boqxo yaqˤuł, yił kidber siskin šebin keze roqxanu.
\g 
\l Afterwards the boy said: "Mother, we will get half of the khinkali each today, that girl will get nothing, because she hasn't done a thing."

\t Walah, eli paydax boqsi.
\g 
\l "By God, we became...(???)

\t Elo bertenyoł žedur imadu esa koƛ’ixosi žek’utow iqinanu.

\l They couldn't get a man there on the wedding, who could tell tales [to them?].

\l The girl went away and [saying] "I had a dream like this!", told to her father about what that boy had told.

\t Sida quł, kidno howlotow xecin, eniwn, užin ʕaƛa bik’ixozo sida bertenyołxor bik’in.

\l One day, they left the girl there like this again and mother and son went to a marriage in the village.

\t Užä žawab teƛno, šida mi di begirno xecixanu, dowƛ’aygon q’ʷariłiƛ’ din oqzaƛ’ƛin.

\l The boy answered, "Why would I not leave you, when I'm much more sad than you?"

\t Beɣet’a yizi yałzaytow yizis eniwn yexun, babiya baru yownƛax.
\g 
\l It is said that when they both were young, their mother died and their father married a[nother] wife.

\t Žeduƛ’ ci sadaq’a yołƛin.
\g 
\l Their name is Alms."

\t Sida quł sasaqaza Kusa istolowäy išxo zown.

\l One day in the morning, Kusa was eating in the dining room.

\g 
\l She put the feather that fell from that pigeon onto her father's hat, and threw the golden whool that fell from the ram onto the chest and asked: "Daddy, does it fit?"

\t Ozzaq reƛ’ibin riħin, č’uran rukarerno, Bilq’isdä žedu xizor begirno.
\g 
\l Bilqisdi put her hands over their eyes and caused them to see the light, then she sent them back.

\t Yoɣno kurno yičäruni aɣˤux elus xabaryabin teqerno siskin buyn bäčinč’i, hudu t’o ela sidä sidqo kesubi esix sasaqor bičan.

\g 
\l There he asked a young person who sat at the village square for water, and one got up, pissed into a mug and gave it to him and he said: "Behold, what is this? A human is not allowed such a thing as to drink urine instead of water!"

\t ʕAƛox bitaz yałruni gogaƛ’arno yižin, ʕoloqza eč’ibi caƛix Bilq’isdi tełxor cucik’no.
\g 
\l The young people led her onto a meadow that was distant from the village, threw pebbles onto her and buried her under them.

\t Režet’ani ƛoħazaɣor reƛno riħurno, waħaza c’i erno.
\g 
\l They poured the meat into big pans and set up a fire below.

\t Ħumukuliƛa bukaynč’u elur, amma nełas sipat debeq esan elaƛin”.
\g 
\l "We didn't see any camel, but we will tell you how it looks."

\t Žedu q’ˤunesno q’ut’i boqno šebi rodinon ža nesi xedyoxay yok’ek’anix.
\g 
\l The two of them agreed to remove her from that husband by all means.

\t Q’ˤano äƛiru ɣudƛ’ogon yeda ayzaƛ’or resun istowliƛ’ riguƛ’ay rigu biša eqräsi.
\g 
\l On the second day then, when he came, he found the richest food put on the table.

\t Howži yedu yexusƛin, yisä rečuƛerno yižin, rekuł šušin.
\g 
\l "Now she died.", he (tought and) carried her into the cattleshed and buried her in manure.

\t Hudayzikotow beže bertenno bodin, xanä nesix, ziruz kumakyoƛ’aza, kidno yegirno.
\g 
\l The next day they had a big wedding; due to the help of the fox, the king gave him his daughter.

\t Horo dädäɣor.
\g 
\l "Come to me!

\t Guluza di akik’xanuƛin, žawab teƛno guluzaxozo aħa.
\g 
\l "Horses don't make me tired," answered the horse shepherd.

\t Howlotow nełar riyn ža reƛ’a łas yałrułi, neła q’orolays reƛ’a yoł žaƛin esin neła xanqo.
\g 
\l And there she knew whose hand it was: "It's this widow's hand.", she told the king.

\t Yeda ukayruntow, neł kidbes yisiqor roƛ’i boqno.
\g 
\l Immediately when she saw him, she fell in love with him.

\t Hudun žedu nełaƛ’ ƛ’iri butin ɣudi rayrno, elułäy sidxokin mi nexinč’inäy, bazaryarno yižin teƛa yołƛin.
\g 
\l Nevertheless, they tortured her again: "If you don't marry any of us, we will take you to the market and sell you!"

\t Yedu kidno t’otow xecixƛin.
\g 
\l I am also leaving that girl here.

\t Badiru daru baqinč’iƛin Bilq’isdä nesi eženi žek’us łˤonon užibi muk’urno boyrerno, buyxor xabarno esirerno žeduq.
\g 
\l "(Otherwise) the medication won't work.", Bilqisdi made the old man's three sons confess and made them tell the true story.

\t Užä eƛin, šida mi di xʷasar boda bayxanu, dowƛ’äygon q’ʷariłiƛ’ oqzaƛ’ diƛin.

\l The boy said, "Why would I not save you, when I'm much more sad than you?"

\t K’ox äƛirugon Ħon-Bahadurä kurno c’eruc’a - aždaħez rok’eł č’aq’ˤin.

\l Then, after the king's daughter heard the prettiest melodies coming out of the box, she just had to buy it.

\t Di mi ɣurox egiranƛin odäsi zownč’u.
\g 
\l "I didn't give birth to you to have you pasture the cows.

\t Yisiƛ’ bužzin yoqinč’ey nełas eniw yäk’iru, žan hemedurtow aždaħä yexurno.
\g 
\l That dragon likewise killed her mother, who didn't believe this, and went there.

\g 
\l They lived in great poverty.

\t ʕAƛoxor aynosigon dibirno goƛ’in, maharno erno, ixiw bertenno bodin.

\l When he came into he village, he called the imam, organized a wedding and threw a big marriage.

\l When they arrived there, they found the boy's house, went inside and said: "You tricked us, give us back our camels and the goods that were on them!"

\t Adäztown rič’in zawru šuda teł žedun šušin.
\g 
\l And they were buried in the grave they had digged before.

\t Bisno q’ˤano besuron bac’ad boyn, łˤono äƛiru boyƛ’oräy, nełaz k’esma aɣiw qˤod yesun.
\g 
\l He took two fish and cleaned them, and when he took the third one, he found a hole in its gullet.

\t Xizyogon xabar esanix boc’i boqno, eluz maduhalłiq ičixozo xanez kidbes sis ozuri rexasi yoł.
\g 
\l Then the wolf began to tell a story: "The daughter of the king who lives in our neighbourhood is blind on one eye.

\t Iqiran iqirno yizä ža beže iħuz lilyoxor ižin.
\g 
\l They caught him and brought him to the bank of a large river.

\l When he went to a village out of need and came back, he met a young boy named Akhmed from his village.

\t Mi dey uži yołƛin nesä eƛizaƛ’or, łox kikibi ƛisin užä nesis.
\g 
\l Until he said "You are my son.", the boy pulled his breasts three times.

\t Xanä urɣizikin oqxo ičinč’ey nesir žawab teƛno, boƛƛik’u dey ric’q’i neƛa yoł deberƛin.

\l The king wasn't thinking and answered him: "I will give you half of my wealth!"

\t Hoboygon šebi roqno, ziruƛin?” - esirno zeyä.
\g 
\l "And what happened now, fox?", asked the bear.

\t Łox äƛiru rayäru bišadyoł zahru anuru biyn yizir, elay bet’urno magalu kurnosi k’et’u bexunč’izaƛ’.
\g 
\l The third time they knew that there was no poison in the food they brought, because the cat for which a [piece of] bread was pulled out and thrown to, wouldn't die.

\t Ži roda šebin anuƛin”.
\g 
\l But now there is nothing to do.

\t Raɣˤin tełer ezunosi, elo teł rigu biša resun.
\g 
\l After he opened it and looked inside, he found good food in it.

\t Sasaqosi xanqo esin, sis xaliča dahaw k’ot’ono riłe yołƛin.

\l In the morning they told the king: "One mat is a little shorter."

\t Onočas pikru boqno, ciqaɣor ža bik’inosi, nełał xizay xal bodin bičanƛin.
\g 
\l The hen had the idea to follow him, when he goes to the forest.

\t Tawadä bigza ħalał xal bodinosi, elo nesir sosi ozuri c’oxno yätiruni kid yukaynanu.

\l Nevertheless, this eyeless man went slowly feeling up and got to a mill someplace.

\g 
\l Not knowing what to do anymore, the mother asked her eldest daughter first, if she would go to the snake; she rejected: "I won't go."; then she talked to the middle daughter, who also disagreed.

\t Di saɣ oynäyƛin, eƛin nesi iguni žek’a, šebi baha mi där boyxƛin.

\l "What happened?", they asked and when they went home, they found the house door locked from inside.

\t Bazarganä roƛik’no eƛuk’yazay bišan, axbin rodin, kʷaxatow hunix boqno.

\l The merchant pulled out food from a leather sack, they stuffed their tummies and soon went on their way.

\l And very soon then, he even let him be the king.

\l "I won't give you a piece, I will give you a whole carcass.", the boy agreed to them.

\l On that day, Hussein had gone into the forest.

\t Aɣin bisno, adäzgon boc’no t’ekan kid xandäɣor yik’in.

\l Before the eagle flew away, it plucked a feather from itself, gave it to him and said: "When trouble comes upon you, if you burn it, it will help you."

\t Žan elay yoɣno, sosi łäłxor kuranƛin oqno yeda.

\l He took it out of there and at first wanted to throw it into the water.

\l When they saw the graves that were made up as of their sons, the mother became very sad; the father, however, didn't reveal any condition.

\t Aq’ˤu mixƛ’or ičinč’eytow imxayn oqno šayxno ayn idur.
\g 
\l Not waiting too long, the sheikh got out of the cave and came home.

\l "I am still unmarried," the doctor gave an answer.

\l Tsirdukh carried her to the king.

\l At first he didn't want to tell it, but then, because his daughter wouldn't leave him, he told: "The king asked a question this Friday: 'What is the blackest, softest and quickest thing?'

\t Sida zamanał, maduhalłiqozo ħukmatyoz xanä yisiƛ’or begirno geres hibo bayrno naza boq’ˤiw, naza kikiw yałru biyrƛin.

\t Eli t’ay narnokin bik’ixanuƛin, bet’un k’oƛin ziru bičin.

\g 
\l "How was he named?", asked the bear.

\t Igorno ik’in babiya č’arik’nosi, užir retinanu, dahawgon šida di moƛał xecinč’uƛin.
\g 
\l The father came closer and after waking him up, the son didn't like it [and said]: "Why didn't you let me sleep a little more?"

\t Där retinäy di guluƛ’no zawƛin, eƛin žeduqor guluzaxoza.
\g 
\l "I will ride on a horse whenever I want," said the horseman.

\t Din nesi xander ʕarzaƛ’ ayäsi zows.
\g 
\l And I also came to this king with a complaint.

\l On the third day, the king sent sixty henchmen and let them bring the two siblings and Sun's Uneyzat.

\t Hemełtow zamanał, k’oƛin rik’in yizi aħozis barur kumak boda.
\g 
\l At that time they ran to help the shepherd's wife.

\g 
\l No matter how long they looked, they did not find him.

\t Sidaquł azu kosiƛ’oräy, zirun, zeyn hemedurtow sadaq mečołxor rik’in.
\g 
\l One day, while gathering the harvest, the fox and the bear went to the field together.

\t Elor bayrun, muši begira Ħasan q’ˤida ičiƛ’oräy ox̌-x̌o-x̌oyƛin eƛin.
\g 
\l As soon as they arrived there, while Hassan sat down to take a breath, he said: "Oh-ho-hoy!"

\t Q’arumä adäz äru šebin rac’no.
\g 
\l Qarum ate the things that were put in front [of him].

\t Hunin regirno xizor yutin nexanƛin, yigtow yedu ƛ’iri yutizaƛ’, eniyan yegirno.

\l When she insisted: "I will see her off and come back again!", the mother let her go.

\t Qura ƛˤebaƛ’aza oƛixno k’oƛin ža ečruni žek’u, sis uži där neƛa ayƛin.
\g 
\l Twenty years later, the old man appeared [and said]: "One sone has to be given to me!"

\t Sosi reƛ’ibi risa min, kidno bitazoni ɣˤutkaɣor horoƛin”.
\g 
\l "At first you and your daughter will go to the next room to shake hands."

\t Däzoq’aw ɣˤutkun rodoƛin, xanä eƛin kidbez xedyoqor, maday madargon mesedyos ƛen eroƛin.
\g 
\l "Build a house like mine", said the king to his daughter's husband, "and construct a golden bridge from door to door!"

\g 
\l The next day in the morning, the woman was showing around the ring on her hand, and while being on the market, a boy came and asked: "What's its price?"; she said: "You won't afford its price."

\t Q’ˤanon esnabi sadaq hunix roqno.
\g 
\l And so the two sisters went on their way together.

\t Xizyo aɣä nesir meɣu teƛno.
\g 
\l Afterwards, the bird gave him an udder.

\t Meɣu där neƛ, deber di ʕansa neƛanƛin daʕba boyn ičin ečruni žek’u.
\g 
\l "Give me the udder and I will give you the walking stick!", the old man argued.

\t Roda šebinon koƛ’inč’ey yisä bečnaqay reč’no reƛ kurno, howlaytow ric’no iyos zok’in et’no haqa.
\g 
\l Not knowing what else to do, he cut meat off from his knee and threw it to the eagle, them he filled the blood into a mug and poured it into its mouth.

\t Neła quł užä ɣuro kamirno.
\g 
\l On that day, the boy lost the cows.

\l When he was just finished making the food, that very span-sized man appeared riding on the rooster, jumped off, greeted, and right when he sat down, he asked for food.

\t Kʷaxatow baq’ˤu ahli kumakyorƛin bayn k’oƛin.
\g 
\l Quickly many people came running in order to help.

\t Neł ʕaƛos xalq’i besun yisir asaɣor reƛ’ibin kurno, qema regirƛin Allahqo harizi boqxo.
\g 
\l He found the people of the village spreading out their hands into the sky pleading God: "Send us rain!"

\t Sasaq bizinosi, ža uži ganƛ’on zown hunix oqno.
\g 
\l The next morning, when he got up, the boy got on his way riding on the bull.

\t Nełan, dey užiƛin, žaq ałni bic’no.
\g 
\l She also said: "My son!", and gave him a hug.

\t Moƛaq iqirač’iniƛäy yisä yisis baša bicin sasaqor t’eq’erbašiƛ’or ičin.
\g 
\l In order not to fall asleep, he tied his finger and was cautious till the morning came.

\t Sida quł neła nełasno, eniwsno sidaƛ’or šeƛ’un rutirno, žan rižin ciqaɣor yoxin.

\l One day she collected the clothes of herself and her mother and carrying them escaped into the forest.

\t Qunyox yałru bežet’anizaz beƛ’ˤes reqenyoł sis čanya zown q’ˤano cek’i bodäsi.
\g 
\l The oldest one, who was on the farmstead, had a goat in his herd which gave birth to two goat kids.

\t Baq’ˤu xalq’i nesider bayn, di ža c’ohor yołƛin.
\g 
\l Many people came to him: "I am that thief."

\t Nełdäy xexbin rižin, k’ucin, k’et’us xexoybin nełder kurno.
\g 
\l She took away the children from her and put the puppy and the kitten do her.

\t Q’ˤidan ičin his xuxix zawru bara esirno, łinaƛ’ mi qoqƛäƛin.
\g 
\l His wife who was sitting there combing wool asked: "What were you laughing about?"

\t Xizyogon zira eƛin, walla, howža di eƛix zowali łiłiroƛ’ozoni ɣunoqay yaqˤułer ƛˤebno yok’ek’no.
\g 
\l Then the fox said: "By God, someone stole the leaf from the tree on that ditch I talked about.

\t Dibirä esirno nesiq, mi žeduq cirabi esirinč’aƛin.
\g 
\l The imam asked him: "Haven't you asked for their names?"

\t Esin xediya babiya äsiru xabar.
\g 
\l The husband told what his dad had said.

\t Acxor wazir aynosi, nesir eženi esiya eƛix teqno:
\g 
\l When the vizier came to the door, he heard the eldest brother say:

\t Nesis zown užin kidno.

\l He had a son and a daughter.

\t Ža rukayxow, k’et’uz elo aw yołƛin rok’ƛ’orno rayn bet’un bˤeƛez q’ˤimƛ’or k’oƛin.
\g 
\l Seeing this, the cat thought there was a mouse and jumped onto the pig's head.

\t Baq’ˤu q’ʷarid boqno ɣʷˤadi howži, didurtow di ziruł adäzar bik’anƛin.
\g 
\l The crow became very sad, [thinking]: "Now, how will I go before the fox?"

\t Elaygon bitor žeda žedude sadaq hunix k’et’un boɣno.
\g 
\l From there they took the cat with them further on their way.

\t Howsi ʕabdalƛ’o bužzi oqsi diƛin, izin elay oqno maħor ik’in dibir, q’ˤuya mečoƛ’ baru k’edanixƛin.

\l "And I had believed in that fool!", said the mullah, got up from there and went away to search for his wife in another place.

\t Kidbazade sadaq di baɣmaɣor yoqan yaħna-yik’anix, elay di yok’ek’anix nesis hunar ʕeze boqnäy, nesis murad t’ubazi baqƛin.

\l "I will go out into the garden together with the girls to take a walk, if his talent is enough to steal me from there, his wish will be fulfilled."

\t Xizyo nesä Ražbadinqor eƛin, riynč’ey raqru łinarno šebin rodan.

\t C’ik’iw yizi kecnosi, neł aždaħä c’in erno ɣoɣoru ʕamołno eqerno geres hibo ɣoɣorik’a boqno.
\g 
\l When all of them slept, the dragon made a fire, put an iron staff onto the coals and began to make it red-hot.

\t Tełxor ižiƛ’oräy, kidbä nesi žaqor aq’ˤlu bodin, barkatawni ħiƛ’oqu gurow q’ˤuya šebin eniwqay risanix mi razi aqno.

\l When she led him inside, the girl gave the boy an advice: 'Don't agree to take anything else from my mother than the blessed handkerchief!'

\t Kurzak’ugon yisiłäyn boqno xizay k’oƛin.
\g 
\l And he became a falcon and ran afterwards.

\g 
\l When he heard what Kusa said, the king immediately sent the other advisors outside and asked him: "Why did you throw a golden ruble up and said this?"

\t Sida quł ʕaƛoz xalq’imoq łin rixra regirinč’ey, sida kikƛ’o aždaħ baq’ˤułno.
\g 
\l One day, a dragon covered a spring and didn't let the people of the village fetch water.

\t Neširutow bˤeƛä c’idoƛ’or ƛoħon rizirno, qˤay łäxay buta begirno.
\g 
\l At night, the pig put the pan on the fire and sent the hare for water again.

\t Nedur resunäyƛin, - eƛin onoča, - sasaq qaciƛ’or di bik’a yołƛin”.
\g 
\l "If that's the case," said the hen, "I will go after firewood tomorrow."

\t Buqbetaxar kidbä siskin ziya kamirinč’ey, posures reqenno ʕaƛar bayrno yayn.
\g 
\l Toward sunset, the girl hadn't lost any cow and led the cattle's herd back to the village and came back.

\t Eženi esiya eƛin:
\g 
\l The eldest brother said:

\t Xizyo xanä nesir žawab teƛno:
\g 
\l After that, the king answered him:

\t Xizyo yisä eƛin, yedu dey baħaray meža šida xedyox yegirxoƛin.
\g 
\l Afterwards he said: "Why do you marry off my fiancee to another husband?"

\t Elo bišanixƛin q’ˤida bičinosi žedus Kusaƛ’ ozuri c’oxno.
\g 
\l After they sat down in order to eat, their eyes fell on Kusa.

\t Elaygon bitor yik’iƛ’oräy yedu sida beže ʕaƛar yayn.
\g 
\l When she went further from there, she came to a big village.

\t Kaɣatyoƛ’ rukaräsi zown Tawadä, däz žade sadaq Tiblisä t’et’erxo zawru halmaɣbin bayxosi yołƛin.
\g 
\l In the letter it was also pointed out that some friends who were studying together with the son in Tbilisi were coming.

\t Tabanaw biħanayn žedu q’ˤanon.
\g 
\l The two of them fought very long.

\t Dey esnabi, babiya badiru wasiyatyoƛ’ req’un t’o mesedyos łˤono saħ biča bay, amma t’o q’ˤano taraw saħ anu.
\g 
\l "My brothers, according to father's fulfilled legacy, 3 Sah of gold must be here, but here is nothing more than 2 Sah.

\t Sosigon žoyä łˤono ɣˤurušno teƛno, eženi žek’uqor ʕaq’lu bodoƛin eƛin.
\g 
\l Again, the boy gave him the third ruble and said to the old man: "Give me an advice!"

\t C’unt’i, c’ʷant’i t’ekzo šilaƛ’, t’eq’urzo aħyaƛ!
\g 
\l Tsunti-tswanti, over the horn of a goat, under the ear of a biennial goat.

\t Yegiranir mi di elo teł yišäsi anuƛin, yisän žawab teƛno.
\g 
\l "I didn't lock you in there to let you out again", he answered.

\t Łox äƛirugon nełatow c’enno uži ʕiyayn, žigon šebi nesir retäƛin, eniya bayan bisnosi, yeženi esiya eƛin:
\g 
\l When she pinched the boy for the third time and he cried, again, his mother asked, what he wanted again now, so the eldest sister said:

\t Ozno xizok’no biłe bičirno Ismaʕil ʕArabuzande dandir ik’in ʕoƛira putceni kedonno yisno, biƛira putcenigon kedon nełaqno zown.
\g 
\l Ismail [kept the army as if they were pushed back?] and went towards Arabuzan, having taken the seven-pood sledgehammer, while she took the eight-pood sledgehammer.

\t Hemedur Kusa ayn osugani ezä teł babiya yuqˤno yičirno zawruni kidbeder.
\g 
\l So Kusa came to the girl who was being grounded hidden inside the high fortress by her father.

\t Elay bitor ik’iƛ’oräy, yeda eɣeni esiw sidaɣ ʕaƛar ayn.
\g 
\l While going away from there, the young brother came into a village someplace.

\t Babiya uži Okude sadaq egirno xecin.
\g 
\l The father sent his son together with Oku.

\t Žedude sadaq kumakyor xalq’in zown.
\g 
\l And they had people with them for help.

\t Elo yizir didiwnkin ukru besun anu.
\g 
\l There they didn't find any silver at all.

\t Bečedawni žek’u razi oqno.
\g 
\l The wealthy man agreed.

\t Tamaša oqno ƛexun eɣeni esiw, łuey yedu t’o idu nediw bercinłi rodisƛin.
\g 
\l The younger brother got very surprised: "Who the heck has done such a beauty here at home?"

\t Q’aymoxor baynosi, bˤeƛä šida boxäƛin esirnosi, qˤayä elo didiwƛa žek’u yołƛin eƛin.
\g 
\l After coming to the tent, the pig asked: "Why did you run away?" and the hare said: "There is some man there!"

\t Tupin ħiroq caƛin, gulun bˤaƛoyn, eɣeni uži lel yaƛ’ˤuruni aɣeł xizay oqno.
\g 
\l The youngest son threw the rifle over his shoulder, harnessed the horse and went to find the bird that lost its feather.

\t Raładyołxorno yiħun, muhumozas qotno ric’no yoƛixno eƛin, šibaw žek’uz akä sist’a muhu eqro, elay bitorsi debi ħalt’i anuƛin.

\l She went into the sea, filled her hand with grains, reappeared and said: "Put one grain into the window of each man, besides that there's no more work for you."

\t Zowsƛin”, nesiƛ’no hemedurtow ža žek’u razi oqno.
\g 
\l "There was", the man agreed this time as well.

\t Łˤora ɣudƛ’az beže bertenno bodin, idur kidno yown.

\l They organized a three days lasting marriage and he brought the girl home.

\t Sida quł babiyan, best’al eniyan yedu ʕaƛoz posurxo yegirno, qˤašder boƛik’u magalun erno.
\g 
\l One day the father and the stepmother sent her to the village's cattle, preparing for her half of the bread for lunch.

\t Där exuntow riguƛin, žoyä eƛin.
\g 
\l I would rather die.", said the boy.

\t Elozo ʕaƛos xalq’imo yisir micxir teƛa boqno, amma eɣeni esiya eƛin, där mežus bečełi ħažat anu.
\g 
\l The people in the village there began to give him money, but the young brother said: "I don't need your riches.

\t T’ok’ow roda šebin koƛ’inč’ey, q’ˤuyzaɣaɣor dawlaƛ’ zirun bik’in.
\g 
\l Not knowing what to do anymore, the fox went after prey somewhere else.

\t ʕOloqzas zigara boƛixno, howži šebi rodanƛin.
\g 
\l The young people started to complain: "What shall we do now?"

\t Bertenyoł, keč’ qˤaƛoƛin, boc’ä ʕomoyq harizi rodin.
\g 
\l On the marriage, the wolves asked the donkey: "Sing a song!"

\t Hemeł zamanał žader yexora kot’u yołäsi sis ečru žek’u oƛixno k’oƛin žaq esirno, šida mi nece q’ʷarid ičäsiƛin.
\g 
\l Some time later an old man with a long beard came running and asked the boy: "Why are you so sad?"

\t Hudäyzikogon idu biša rodanix sideni bełiqan ičin.
\g 
\l The [second?] day after that, another hunter stayed home to make food.

\t Meža barubi raƛin”.
\g 
\l Find wives to marry!"

\t Esnabi, muši kuracekin ričinč’ey, aždaħqay raqruce maqˤir roxin rik’anił ričix zown.
\g 
\l The sisters, not even waiting a single breath, were running away from the dragon to get far away from it.

\t Nesan hemedurtow kaƛ’inč’iƛin žawab teƛno.
\g 
\l Also he gave the answer likewise: "I can't."

\t Neł bertenyołer hokobin sadaq gulubin rayrno tabanaw xalq’i bayn.

\l To that marriage came many people, bringing carriages and horses.

\t Hemedur q’ˤunesno micxirno łiyn, babiya žarƛin c’unzi rodin xecin zawruni micxiryosno, mesedyosno ixinno łiyrno yizä.
\g 
\l So the two guys' money was finished, and the bag of money and gold that the father left for his son they finished as well.

\t Nełaqno sis magalu beɣe biłe boqno.
\g 
\l For her one bread became too small.

\t Roƛo räsruxor, kidno teƛno, kidbez babiya uži hunix nesä nesiz ʕaƛaɣor egirno.
\g 
\l According to arrangement, the girl's father gave his daughter to the boy and sent him to his village.

\t Hudu šebi di rodinäy xedyoxay bat’an yoqno där etixosi äqiƛin, esirno riynoxuq.
\g 
\l "So what shall I do to get rid of my husband and get my lover?", she asked the sheikh.

\t Sis zown c’aq’tow sider sis betäsi užin kidno.
\g 
\l Once there was a boy and a girl who loved each other very much.

\t Didur roqłin, žoyä eniw muk’ur yodin xanes kid esira yik’a.
\g 
\l Somehow the boy persuaded his mother into going to ask the king's daughter.

\t Nesä eƛin:
\g 
\l He said:

\t Idurno yižin yiła yaɣˤin tełer yezunosi, bercinaw ƛ’iräy ozuri boɣa betixanusi, kid yesun.
\g 
\l She carried it home, opened it and when she looked inside, she found a girl so beautiful that she didn't want to take her eyes off from her.

\t Xizyo xedya esin bazarganzan nesän roƛo räsrułäy.
\g 
\l Then the husband told of what was between the merchants and himself.

\t Didurnokin t’omceni žek’a ħal bayrinč’izaƛ’, sideni bełiqanä roɣno k’onč’ałer tupi caƛin.
\g 
\l As they couldn't overcome him, the other hunter took a rifle and shot him in the leg.

\t Babiwq žan biqira k’ʷeze boqnoanu.
\g 
\l The father couldn't catch him either.

\t Di ayzaƛ’or xuxin ek’no hisno, där bigu, qema regirxanusi butni bodoƛin.
\g 
\l Before I come back, comb and spin the wool, and make a good burka for me, that doesn't let the rain go through."

\t Howži yizi esnaza ħukmu bodin, yisi užä elur kumak bodinč’us yołi, yiła ƛˤoreł eli beɣa zows, horo ela yisix elus esiy yegiranƛin.
\g 
\l Now those brothers came to a decision: "If that boy hadn't helped us, we would have been defeated in that war; so come, let's marry off our sister to him!"

\t Bišno boqnosi, esnabin maħor begirno, eɣeni esiya igorno ik’in Kusaq esirno, sasaqay soder q’ˤimno riqirno, bišadyoƛ’orno aq’ˤułnowa mi ičäsi, šebi deber q’ʷariłi boqäsiƛin.
\g 
\l After having eaten, the young brother sent his brothers outside, approached Kusa and asked him: "What sadness has happened to you so that you are sitting there over your food holding your head."

\t Nełas yałru žedur mumpaʕat biynosi, yizä ža ʕansa muroƛ’orno butirno, kidbez kočorał caƛin.
\g 
\l When they understood the benefit of it, they turned this walking stick into a needle and put it into the girl's hair.

\t Ža xabarno esin, aw adäzay gugin.
\g 
\l Having told this, the mouse ran out of sight.

\t Šida yałru debertow räyƛin, kidbä uži ezuranix bitazoni ɣˤutkaɣor ižin.
\g 
\l "You will know why", the girl [said and] lead the boy into the next room to show him.

\t Yizä yedu iday maħortow yegirxo zown anu.
\g

\g 
\l Before mounting the horse, Musa said to him:

\t Yedugon łinarey bˤoƛ’usƛin? - eƛin žoyä - ži bičas babiwz wasimoƛ’ req’unƛin”.

\l "Why the heck has this fallen down?", said the boy, "Now my father's will will be fulfilled."

\t "Yaqˤułenč’e mi däder dandixno, narčey mi däqay yok’äłƛin?".
\g 
\l 'Today you came to me, where will you escape from me to?'.

\l And the lover lay down to sleep on the sofa, just like at home, and waited for him to pass away.

\t Tełer bik’in bezuzaƛ’, ʕoƛnon esnabi haqa bogun bezun ƛexun.
\g 
\l When the seven brothers went inside and took a look, they remained looking with an open mouth.

\t Xander baynosi, yedu reƛ di riqirsiƛin sidä eƛin, ay di riqirsiƛin sis ičin, hemedur nukarza xanqo heresi esin.
\g 
\l After they came to the king, one said: "I caught this meat.", one insisted: "No, I caught it!", so the henchmen lied to the king.

\t Sayɣat teƛanix ža uži tełxor aƛin eniya nełaq di goƛ’irersi.

\t Yiziqgon Aħmadä esirno žiƛboyä yeda, eƛ’iyä exasiƛin.

\l The older sister found the clothings in the wooden case that were cut to pieces, took the scissors and threw them outside.

\t Anƛ’ima baħnayłin žeduq nedugani reƛis sis t’it’ukin riqinanu.
\g 
\l Although they walked around for a week, they could not get even a piece of such a meat.

\t Esin šebi, xecin šebi sis zown ɣˤanabi.
\g 
\l Once upon a time, there was a woman.

\t Daɣaw bičintowgon zira im-m-m-m, im-m-m-mƛin eƛin.

\l Waiting for a while, the fox said "Mhmhmh, mhmhmh."

\l What kind of man are you to come here?", asked him the dragon.

\g 
\l Immediately after coming into the house, he asked her for water to drink, and .......... she said: "You can't drink water here at home, there is a dragon sitting on the spring, and every day if someone doesn't give him a grown-up to eat, he won't let water to the village."

\t Aždaħa qˤaƛu rok’nosi kičuriču rayzaƛ’ riłe raƛ’no k’ek’-rik’no, yizin bižin taqˤo č’aq’ˤirno.

\l The dragon released a shout, and moved the earth like by an earthquake, and thus caused them to fall far away.

\t Howži łeɣin biħadanix, sidä sis bizirxo bok’xo yiła aždaħä ħaltown bayrinč’ey baq’ˤu aq’ˤuba bukayn yisi ʕAliqiličer.

\g 
\l Batsali turned the water into the cave which the wolf was inside.

\t Nełƛ’ay soder łˤoran haq’uzas bigu ʕumru boqno.

\l As of then, the three families' lives became pretty.

\t Ža kid yižinč’ey, babiwde sadaq di äk’inč’iƛingon, xanes uži ičin.

\l "I will not go with my father without that girl," the khan's son said.

\t Neła eƛin, dey uži eloš neła ɣˤutka teł micxir t’et’erxo ičäsi yołƛin.

\t Nesä xʷasar badiruni ceyä, neła nełaƛ’no zowerno, yeda raładno xecin bitaɣor oɣno.

\l It's said that he had a young son.

\t Sis k’ucin, k’et’us xexoyn ałux ruqˤno žedun rižin q’orolay xanez barudäɣor yik’in.

\l They spent the winter on the winter pasture and when just 15 days remained to bring the sheep back to the mountains, the shepherd heard the crows talking among each other.

\t Eženi žek’a eƛin, ža Hulaɣor dawlaƛ’ äk’izay, qazaqza exursiƛin.

\l The old man said: "While he went to Georgia for prey, the Georgians have killed him."

\t Ha, mežus huni regiroƛ, naɣor bik’ixƛin, esirno neła Qartayä.
\g 
\l "Well, may you go your way, where are you going?", asked Qartay.

\t Užiz rok’ƛ’or pikru bayn, dice ixiw ʕaq’lu nesä däq mołäƛin.

\l The boy thought: "How big an advice did he give me?!"

\t Hemedur q’ʷaridno oqno ičin zawru yeda, babiya nesiqor boyn zawruni wasiyat rok’ƛ’or bayn.
\g 
\l So, being so sad, he recalled the legacy handed down to him by his father.

\t Yisiz babiws šudaƛ’osi ħimu yaganix biħun yedu.
\g 
\l It came to lick the tombstone on his father's grave.

\l Once upon a time there was a khan with three sons.

\t Ič’č’an yeɣeni esiya sasiłzaƛ’ortown, xexłiƛ’ iduɣor ƛaƛin daʕba bičirłin, nełqor žedu ʕenekizi roqnoanu.

\l Although the youngest sister argued: "We have to go home quick before it gets dark!", the didn't listen to her.

\t Kidbezno baruzno rožƛ’ay iziłxanusi žek’u zown ža.
\g 
\l The man could not get away from his daughter's and his wife's words.

\l Getting cross, Batsali asked: "Did you eat my goats?!"

\t Bažarizi raq, šida däq roqxanuƛin, yeženä bašiqˤoyn risno yizin xanzo madazaxaɣor yik’in.
\g 
\l "I can, why not?", the old woman took the ring, got up and went to the king's yards.

\t Bertenyoł zawruni ahli ʕažaib boqno nesä äƛiru łinaƛ’no.

\l The people who were on the marriage were surprised about what he had said.

\g 
\l The doctor also said, "I will cure your son in one year."

\t Zeyn, zirun, boc’in elo sasaqorno ričin, qˤašiƛ’aɣor roqno rik’in.
\g 
\l The bear, the fox and the wolf waited there until the morning and when it got dawn, they went away.

\t Yizis baqru xabarno teqerno, q’ˤanon xanes nukarbi - režet’ani xanes esnabi - bičäsi zown.
\g 
\l Their talking was heard by two of the king's henchmen - the king's older sisters.

\t Łˤonon gulubi rayn adäza ričin aluk’an, qˤaban, c’udan.
\g 
\l Three horses came and waited in front [of him], a white one, a black one and a red one.

\t Xizyo baħarayn yižin xanes užin ik’in nesä nesiz babiwdäɣor, sadaqgon nesiz esiws xedyos kidno yižin.

\l Afterwards, the prince took the fiancée with himself and went to his own father, and together with him he took his sister's husband's daughter.

\t Bazarganza eƛin, debi hibo ela becursiƛin.
\g 
\l The merchants said: "We broke your stick."

\t Łˤonon barubin rown, Ismaʕilä nełqay ža łˤora ɣudi bertenno boyn.
\g 
\l Ismail married the three wives and three days in a row celebrated his marriage.

\t Bˤeƛ’xozoni aħozä eƛin:
\g 
\l The shepherd said:

\t Šebiey yiłar roqsiƛin, yeda ezu-ʕoƛ’a ik’in.
\g 
\l "What in the world has happened to her?", he went to visit her.

\t Elo nesä elo c’oxno, t’o c’oxno č’iħo rac’a bašla bodin.
\g 
\l There, pouncing here and there, he began to eat the fruits.

\t Rišno łiynosi, p’es anusi baruza Umukus cugumä tełer zeruyałer kurno.
\g 
\l After they finished eating, the wives silently threw Umukus into the bouza inside the barrel.

\g 
\l He pretended to search for the scissors everywhere and finally took it from under Bilqisdi's mattress and gave it to the king: "Here, the scissors which cut off your horses tail."

\t Elaygon bitor ik’iƛ’oräy, yäsu deber aluk’a ɣˤul.
\g 
\l And when you go further, you will find a white stone.

\t Elay izin ik’in bigtow manzil xecinosi, žedu esnabi biħanayx zawru mečoƛ’or ayn yeda.
\g 
\l He got up and went away, and when he left a great distance after himself, he came to the place where those brothers were fighting.

\t Užä eƛin, Allahä didurƛa caxäsi resan, däz babiyan ƛirba ayruxort’a bˤeƛ’es šebin rexayx zows, sida qułkin ža bišan kamin (giħiłno) ƛexunč’u ža, din hemedurtow ƛäxunč’iƛin.
\g 
\l The boy said: "God might have written it somehow; my father used to slaughter a sheep for every guest who came, and he wasn't without food for even a day; so I will be as well."

\t Hemedur guluƛ’no zown xanes uži maħor oqno yok’ek’alini esiwł xizay.
\g 
\l So the prince rode on his horse outside behind his stolen sister.

\t Sida zamanałäza xabar teqxo, xanä nesä nesiz ozyołer ʕoloqbi bisxoƛin.
\g 
\l After a while he hears the story that the king is taking young people into his army.

\t Xanä žedu nesä nesidäɣorno goƛ’in sosi eženi esiwq esirno:
\g 
\l The king called them to himself and first asked the eldest brother:

\t Howt’aza bitor didiw ħumukuli bäk’iru di biyran mežur retinäy:
\g 
\l If you want, I will find out for you what camel went from there.

\l After the dogs that were running behind it, went far away, the hunter said to the snake: "Come out, now your enemies went out of sight."

\t Ruysi reƛ’iqoybi resʷa behila mežzoxƛin, - eƛin žoyä, - amma endiw däzoq’aw anu žeduƛin”.

\l "One might perhaps find simple gloves at your's," the boy said, "but they're not like the one I have."

\t Hemedur q’ecenyayx žedu ʕuraw mixƛ’or ƛexun.
\g 
\l So they were arguing for a long time.

\l "I was extremely afraid.", said the boy.

\t Nełaq dicegon raq’ˤu biša roqłin, ɣˤʷayr neła magalas sis t’it’ukin kurnoanu.
\g 
\l But no matter how much food she had, she didn't throw even one piece of the bread to the dog.

\t Bełiqa eƛin, horo, oxi där tupiƛ ħažoƛin.
\g 
\l The hunter said: "Come, exchange it for my rifle!"

\t Nesiƛ’ cin Ismaʕilƛin zown.

\l His name was Ismail.

\t Žeduqor bitor hunix ik’iƛ’orey siskin xabar bexarno.

\l When you go further on the way, the story will go on.

\t Dahawtowgon zaman bik’izaƛ’or, xizyogon acmoq deqƛin.
\g 
\l After a little while, it knocked on the door again.

\t Babiyagon nesiqayn bisno, ža micxir c’idaɣor kurno.
\g 
\l The father than took the money from him and threw it into the fire.

\t Mi nełas rask’i urɣel badinƛin, sida q’urec’niƛ’ ƛ’iri ixin erno, hisos urgubi äruni sideni q’urec’niƛ’ ƛ’iri yeda zowerno.

\l "Don't worry!", they put his bag onto the mule and seated him on the other mule that carried the sacks of wool.

\t ƛˤeb yik’inosi, sida quł dawlaƛ’ zey maħor boqäsi yałzay, kid nełdayn yoxin ʕaƛaɣor yik’in.
\g 
\l A year went by, and one day while the bear went outside for prey, the girl ran away from him and went into a village.

\t Nełƛ’aza rayn kesubi esa adäza, eli bezu-bˤoƛ’a bay yołä t’oza xalq’i anaƛin.

\l Because of that [...?], we must look if there are people here.

\t Elo nełade ƛirbałix yałzay, neširu Qartay maħor yoqacen ičin, izin nełaz mežił ok’bi rok’no xecin.
\g 
\l When he was there at her's as a guest, he waited until Qartay got out at night, got up, beated nails into her mattress and left them there.

\t Žeda eƛixƛax, oc’ira łera ɣudƛ’aza howži ɣutaneł ixiw zigolun yegär, raq’ˤu bˤeƛ’no räxu, rigza ħalał elur reƛno räqiƛin.
\g 
\l They were saying: "Fifteen days from now there will be a big hailstorm on the winter pasture, many sheep will die, and we will have a lot of meat in the trouble."

\t Di t’ay oɣoƛin eženi qˤaƛanayłin, aħyakin kurinč’ey, nesä nesiz guluƛ’no zown, oqno iduɣor ik’in.

\l Although the old man yelled: "Take me out of here!", he didn't even listen, sat upon his own horse and went home.

\t K’ox äƛiru caƛin, hil dahaw ceyde igo yiłe č’aq’ˤinosi, nełaƛ’no k’ek’-bik’noanu.
\g 
\l He shot a second time, and when the bullet hit something near the eagle, it didn't move then either.

\t Ža gulu sis čuret’ bak’run hawaƛ’ bik’in, ʕoƛno ħonno xecin bitazar bayxosi zown.
\g 
\l This horse went into the air after one beat with the whip, and leaving behind seven mountains, went far into the distance.

\t Boc’an, zeybin, ɣuro yałza rečuƛ, aɣˤnä teł rišin, aɣbi girimabin kurno idutow xecin, bełis čanyabin, resobin čolow yałza hiɣar regirno.
\g 
\l She drove the wolves and bears into the cowshed where the cows were, erected poles for the birds to give [them] a home, and sent the wild goats and roes into the half-open shed where there was straw.

\t Kidbazä esin, eli babiwde sadaq saparyox roqäsi zows, babiwn gugin howt’o ƛexasi yoł, ela debez ɣunoqay dahaw henešno but’in bac’siƛin.

\l The girls said: "We were travelling together with our father, and he ran away and we were staying here; and we picked some apples from your tree and ate them."

\t Yedu t’azay reɣet’ani bikorbi roƛixsiƛin, oxix yeda elay.
\g 
\l "There are small snakes there!", he said and ran away from there.

\t Howži Ismaʕil ezunč’ey ʕaƛaɣor ik’in nesä nesis łonon barubin rižin.
\g 
\l Now Ismail went into the village without looking and took his three wives with him.

\t Kidbä eƛin, nesis xabar bit’araw yołƛin.
\g 
\l The daughter said: "What he said, is true."

\t Debeq esäru łinarno mi žawab neƛ, guluzałäygon łu debeq esiräƛin, yiziri ƛ’iri butin.

\l "Answer the question we asked you! And who asked you about the horses?", they insisted.

\t Nełaƛ’ razi oqinč’izaƛ’, tamiħyorƛin žeda howt’o iħuz lilyoxor kuräsiƛin, rok’u rexałxor iłe xabaryayn yeda.

\l Because we couldn't come to an agreement, they throw me here onto the river bank as a punishment.", he talked to evoke sympathy.

\t Xizaɣor tatu łiynosi, cey ħalica Ħon-Bahadurzo mač’iqay bok’ełno.
\g 
\l Finally his power ended and the eagle escaped like through a wonder(?) from Mountain~Hero's dagger.

\t Yisił dandir c’axru bełiqa esirno, yedu ziya naɣor bižix miƛin.
\g 
\l A hunter whom he met asked him: "Where are you bringing that cow to?"

\g 
\l Now the rabbit's young went to the place where it had left the shepherd, touched his tongue with its own tongue and took the shepherd's stick for marking it, and returned back to its mother.

\t Elo azbarya teł ža ezu-ʕaƛ’unosi, taxeƛ yisir bexuräsi esnabi besun.
\g 
\l When he examined inside the palace, he found his killed brothers under the ottoman.

\t Yisägon šinaw raqru łinałäyn esin žedaq.
\g 
\l And so he told them everything about it.

\t Ħayran yoqno yezun ƛexun kid, moƛałä yedu di yaqˤułƛin.

\l The girl was surprised and remained looking (at him), "Is this day a dream?"

\t Howži yisi Ħasanes ečriłno lagis tatun bexun, ħalt’i boda biynč’us oqʷa iħun.
\g 
\l Now Hassan's old body ran out of power, and he started getting unable to do the work.

\t Däz butna eli ozuri buqin bˤaɣizaƛ’or dowder bayrinč’us yołi, mi łemu yexa zowsƛin”.

\l Once there was a rich man who had two daughters.

\t Debertow yätiru sis barun yižo mi t’ay, roƛik’u xanłin riso daqäy, howt’otow ičiƛin”.
\g 
\l "Take the wife you love with you, take half of the kingdom from me, but stay here!"

\t Žeda žedur ʕeziyaw reƛ raħiranixgon esiwn yegirno.
\g 
\l The sister did that so they would have much meat for themselves.

\l I'll know what we do to him."

\t Ža soder iziƛ’oräy, qoqoƛix izix zown, wˤałer oqƛ’oräy ʕiyayx oqxo zown.
\g 
\l While he was going up, he laughed, and while he was going down, he cryed.

\g 
\l One day, the fox said to him:

\t Yeženä Beqes ʕUneyzatno, xediwn mˤaliz qˤodreza tełäy maħor begirno, howži mežus req’el boqsiƛin.
\g

\l Goqi believed what the fox said, he took him home and the two lived together.

\l This story went through all the villages around.

\t Xizyogon Ražbadinä äƛiruxor božarawni ʕoloqza ʕaƛos baħarayƛ’ rayzaƛ’or nasin kidbabi rutirno.

\l Then, according to what Razhbadin had said, the reliable young people gathered all girls of the village, including the bride.

\t Elaygon bitor ik’iƛ’oräy, yeda raładyoz lilyoxor ayn.
\g 
\l When he went further, he came to the banks of the sea.

\t Nełaƛ’ žedun razi boqno.

\l They had an old cat.

\t Sida quł esnazas barubi urɣizi roqno sisxolisini žedaz xedyozas esiy zeroqozo cugumäɣor kuranix.

\l One day, the brothers' wives planned to throw their husbands' lonely sister into a barrel of bouza.

\l "If that's the case, make me one wooden case!" she insisted.

\l In exchange for gold, that was found there, they bought something to eat and lived good.

\t Howži yedu aždaħ yisiƛ’or bizin eƛin:

\g 
\l Letting his wife shout out quite loudly, the husband changed his voice and said: "I am here, what do you want?"

\t Elo ža dibir neła kidbeł xizay oqno.
\g 
\l So the imam followed that girl.

\l Then the children asked: "Are we your children or someone else's?"

\l At first, give me the permission to speak to you.

\t Xizyo nesä žeduqor eƛin, howt’o ʕaƛa di łi roƛik’näy, šebi meža där baha boyxƛin.

\t Nełaƛ’no kidbes babiw razin oqno, berten boynč’eytown xanxo Pat’imatno yegirno.
\g 
\l After that, the girl's father agreed and married Fatima off to the king without having a wedding.

\l "If that's the case, turn the carriage back!", said the king.

\t Ħayran boqno ƛexun bežet’ani esnabi, nay yedu deber gulubi riqäƛin esirno.

\l "He doesn't want anything, if he can touch your tongue with his tongue, it will be enough, he said.", explained her young.

\t Nełƛ’ay soder raq’ˤu saɣyatyabi nesä xanez kidber regirno.

\t Xizyo bečedawni žek’a naysinan xabar begirno, howziri ganbi reynodaniƛ’or kuczi radiru žek’ur di sis gani teƛa yołƛin.

\l After that, the rich man spread the word, that he would give one bull to the person, who would be able to make these bulls work.

\t Eniwn, užin hemedur big yołƛin teqnosi, hemesi bečedawni maduhalä neširu rečuƛäy ža gulun bižin, nełaz meča q’ˤuya gulu bicin.

\l That wealthy neighbor heard about good life of that mother and her son and took away that horse out of cattle shed in the evening and tied instead of it another one.

\t Gulun rečuƛ bicin, ža kidno q’ˤuya ɣˤutka teł yuqˤno, esnabi bayaniqor idu ezun ičäsi zown.
\g 
\l He tied the horse into the shed, hid the girl in another room and waited at home for his brothers to come.

\t Waħ, šebi nesir roqnoƛin, Qartayä esirno.
\g 
\l "Oh, what happened with it?", said Qartay.

\t Žan zown małiru risxanusi, t’ubaraw ʕaq’lus anusi iłe.
\g 
\l And he was disobedient and had a defective mind.

\g 
\l The crow became sad and said: "By God, I passed so many mountains; nevertheless while I didn't get anything, I found a grain of maize somewhere and [thinking:] "I will take it anyway!", so while I carried it here anyway, I encountered a high mountain, and while flying higher, I accidentally swallowed and [thus] lost it.

\t Nełƛ’ay bigu eynodanix moči där anuƛin, Alimaħama razi oqno.

\l Convinced that she now has learned to work, the boy sent someone to invite the girl's father.

\t Hemedur nesiq łˤono buci bik’in.
\g 
\l And so three months passed for him.

\t Debi didiw yoł ža huduƛin?”, - esirno kidbä.

\l "So how is this one of yours?", asked the girl.

\t Din begirƛin, rigu raq’ˤu esin zeyä.

\l "Let me in as well!", the bear begged.

\t Akbar roɣno łäyrun, bayn sida ceyä iqirno ižin di maqˤi mečoƛ’ sida c’aq’ bercinaw baɣmar kursi.

\l At the end of my call for the prayer, an eagle came and took me away to a far place and threw me into a very beautiful garden.

\g 
\l "My daughter has turned into a tree."

\g 
\l "The middle one, the most beautiful daughter of the king.", Ismail showed here.

\t Yiłar roda šebinon łaħin, esnazał xizay k’oƛin.
\g 
\l He left the things that were to be done by him and ran behind the brothers.

\t Užin koyä isno yisä nełaqay, narce yedu yäk’iƛin gama tełäy yoqa yegirno xecin.
\g 
\l He took the son from her into his hand, [thinking] "Where could she go?" and let her get out of the boat's inside.

\t Ɣudes sasaqaza elorno rayn sis aluk’a sideni qˤaba miƛ’bi riħanayxosi yoł.
\g 
\l Every day in the morning, one white and one black ram came and were fighting.

\t Buciƛ’ay baq’ˤu zaman bik’in yiziq ža łi k’edix, hudun resunanu.
\g 
\l More than a month passed that they were searching that water, but nevertheless they didn't find it.

\t Xizazgon yisän qˤaƛin nełqor, beže taliħ boqsi debi nedur mi boxin bok’äłruƛin.

\l From behind he shouted: "Your luck was big for having escaped!"

\g 
\l One day, she said to her brothers:

\t Ciqqor baynosi, užä ʕiyada bašla bodin.

\l When they came to a forest, the boy began to cry.

\t Nesä nedur harizi royzaƛ’, sabru bodin bičin bełiqan ħalkaraw mečoƛ’aɣor ok’ełzaƛ’or.

\l Because he asked, the snake waited patiently until the hunter went away to an even field.

\t Zeyä gugu c’eyƛ’oräy, enduräz biynč’ey bik’in zira xizaz c’i atinosi, zeyq regin:
\g 
\l When the bear heated his back, the fox secretly approached and when he set him on fire, the bear said:

\t Žigon xan q’ʷariłiłer egin.
\g 
\l Again, the king was sad.

\t Č’uħaraw šeƛ’un šeƛ’un iduza, madazax aħna-ik’ix yołƛax xan.
\g 
\l The king is said to have gone outside in his gorgeous clothes, taking a walk.

\t Bisno bazarganä yisił adäza raħiräsi reƛis ħit’u eqerno.
\g 
\l The merchant took a pan of cooked meat and put it before him.

\t Zownƛax zownanuƛax ɣudes bełiƛ’ aħnayxosi sis bełiqan.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there was a hunter who went on a hunt every day.

\t Hemedurtow, łox äƛirugon egirno xediw raładyoz raʕalłixor.
\g 
\l And so, for the third time, she sent her husband to the edge of the sea.

\t Bužzi odin yisä Ražbadin.
\g 
\l He trusted Razhbadin.

\t Xizyo xanä nesiq esirno, räk’iru mužmarƛ’o mi ža esinč’uwa, hoboy łu ža debeq esäƛin.

\l Then the king asked him: "You didn't tell this past Friday, now who told this to you?"

\t Yegirxanuƛin et’un k’oƛin ičäsi zown yeda.
\g 
\l "I won't marry her off.", he jumped up.

\t Hudun neła kʷanin bok’no, taqˤorno boqno, kidbabi riqira risƛ’oräy, yoƛƛozoni esiya q’ˤidar muri kurno.

\l Nevertheless, it swam across it and got there, and when it tried to catch the girls, the middle one threw the needle down.

\t Roda šebinno koƛ’inč’ey, ža xan c’aq’ q’ʷaridno oqno ičäsi zown.
\g 
\l The king became very sad and didn't know what to do.

\t Howlay idurno ik’in, xanez užä eniwq esirno, dey aqiw esiw zowwäƛin.
\g 
\l He went home and the prince asked his mother: "Did I have a sister?"

\t Yik’inƛax ža kikxor, elo yiłar ʕuraw biša resun.
\g 
\l She went to the spring and found much food there.

\t Babiya eƛin, moƛ’oqˤoy anusi gulus baha łeno ʕazar ɣuruš yołƛin.
\g 
\l The father said: "The price of the horse without the bridle is 5,000 rubles."

\t Bara ɣˤaɣˤun yizin esirno, rowwä bˤeƛ’ƛin?
\g 
\l His wife got happy and asked: "Did you bring the sheep?"

\t Iduɣor bik’iƛ’oräy, buyxor mec esixoza hersiqanqor eƛin:
\g 
\l When they went home, the one who always told the truth said to the liar:

\t Xizyogon žoyä ʕansan begirno xanes oz č’agun rodin, xande sadaq iduɣor begirno.
\g 
\l Then the boy sent his walking stick, made the king's army alive again and sent them(?) home together with the king.

\t Zira yisiqor eƛin, dice di boc’aq bˤuƛ’äsi zowä, žedaƛ’aygon di debeq bˤuƛ’äsi zows, šida mi di howži begirno xecäƛin.

\l The fox said to him, "I was so afraid of the wolves, and even more afraid of you than of them; why did you leave me here now?"

\t Yeženä eƛin, hemeła pulanaw mečoƛ’ yoł ža, elor ayrun, kakno rodo, łox nełas ci qˤaƛo.

\l The old woman said: "She lives at that certain place, when you arrive there, say a prayer and shout her name three times!"

\t Nełaƛ’ zown yizi bik’in sida šaharyar bayn.
\g 
\l Riding on it, they went on and came to a city.

\t Ismaʕilqo oc’ino biƛno ƛˤeb yaynosi, muʕalimä xanqo riyrno, ƛuza teł yołäsi reƛ täƛno nesirƛin.

\l When Ismail became eighteen years old, the teacher explained to the king: "Do not give him meat that contains bones!"

\t Xalq’in, ʕaƛno bukaynosi, aždaħ nełaq ža biqinč’ey neła nełaz iduɣor, ciqaɣor, boxin.
\g 
\l When the dragon saw the people and the village, it ran back to its own home, towards the forest.

\t Cimyarno bizin neła eƛin, dey eniw yexaru tušman didur mi t’aɣor nexłäƛin.
\g 
\l He, who got furiated, said: "How could you who killed my mother come here?!"

\l In some place, he found a merchant who was drying a carpet.

\t Žan riyn nesiłtow xizay Ox̌oyon k’oƛin.
\g 
\l When he knew it, Ohoyo ran behind him.

\t Ža nesä eƛinosi yeda igtow lamus oqxo, qazaqä yisir bodixosi ħurmat bukayzaƛ’.
\g 
\l When he [Tavadi] said that, he [Razhbadin] became very ashamed, because he saw the respect that the Georgian showed him.

\t Žagon šebiƛin, zira eƛin.
\g 
\l "How's that?", said the fox.

\t Howlotow yiła ƛ’iräy uži oɣno, dey ʕayib boqsi idu yičin howžär nełqor yutin yezunč’ey yičizaƛ’.
\g 
\l Then she apologized to the boy: "It was my fault, because I didn't pay attention on her again, since she has been living with us, until now."

\t Bukayxa eloš bitay qala?
\g 
\l Do you see the fortress there in the distance?

\t Didur eli bišan, bäšru k’et’ukin bexusƛin eƛin xanqor Beqes ʕUneyzatä.
\g 
\l "How could we eat, if even the cat who ate died?", said Sun's Uneyzat to the king.

\t Sis zown zirun zeyn.
\g 
\l Once there was a fox and a bear.

\t Hudayzikotow maħlarno ik’in siryoz bet’erhanä xanez bara äƛiruxor qˤaƛin.
\g 
\l The next day, the mare's master went to the court and shouted what the king's wife told him.

\l The donkey said to his friends: "How does one know [how] it can become useful for us.", had [the wolf] lifted on his back and carried it further.

\t Xan ħayran oqno ezun ƛexun.
\g 
\l The king remained looking surprised.

\t Xexłiƛ’ eƛin ɣˤʷaygon yałru qaciz guluƛ’or butirno.
\g 
\l He quickly said [something] and what has been a dog transformed back into the wooden horse.

\t Xanqay roƛik’u bečełin risno, doxturä sider sis nece betixosi kidno, užin sadaq begirno.
\g 
\l If they loved each other so much, the doctor took the half of the khan's riches and sent the boy and the girl together.

\t Xander ik’a adäza, babiya užiqor eƛin, howži roda šebin anu, dey uži, mi eƛo xanqor mesedyos bic’no q’ili neƛnäy, guluzaz reqenyołäy sis bigu gulu łet’an egirnäy, di neła kidbeł xizay ik’anƛin.
\g 
\l Before going to the king, the father said to the son, "Now there's nothing one can do, my son, say to the king, 'If you give me a qili filled with gold and if you let me pick a good horse from the herd, I will go behind that girl'!"

\t Eniya aħozi iqäru deber.

\l Then, when the king asked his daughter: "Did this vizier come home for the glass?", [she said:] "This vizier didn't come, he came!" and showed him the boy on the bull calf.

\t Neła ƛˤeba q’ˤuyazis raq’ˤu bˤeƛ’ rexun, netin yegirxanuzoce zigolun, isin yegirno.

\g 
\l Atid took a big stick and waited until the mouse came.

\l Not paying attention to them, he went onto the mountain.

\t Hemedur howloza rˤałayzał xexbi yałzay, eɣeni esiwr keroqazay nexxo aždaħ bukayn.

\l On the place where she hit her head, a big window appeared.

\l The fox said:

\t Neła quł sasaq esnaza Umukusno šušin, nełas šeƛ’u šudaƛ’ ƛ’iri eqerno.
\g 
\l The next morning, the brothers burried Umukus and put her clothes onto the grave

\t Nedur resunäy, ža tełxor goƛ’oƛin, eƛin beženi esiya.
\g 
\l "If that's the case, invite him inside!", said the older brother.

\t Howži šebitow radi, šebitow räs diƛin, rok’ƛ’or pikrun bayn ža uži dunyalqo ik’in.
\g 
\l "What shall I do now, what shall I take?", so the boy got the idea to go through the world.

\t Žan risno iduza ezu-ʕoƛ’uƛ’oräy, yisir bečedawni žek’us uži esun.
\g 
\l Taking it into the house, he looked around and found the rich man's son.

\t Howži hudu xan oqno Ismaʕiles barubi q’ˤuyzix regiranix.
\g 
\l Now the king began to send Ismail's wives to others.

\t Sis xexoy yiłar kurnäy, q’ˤano där ƛäxuƛin, rok’ƛ’or pikrun bayn, dicego zaħmat roqłin, yiła zirur xexoy kurno.
\g 
\l "If I throw him down one nestling, I will still keep two", thought the bird and although it was quite difficult, it threw a nestling to the fox...

\t Yałzatow rekan eqerno, taxƛ’o kecno ičin.
\g 
\l He put the key where it was and slept on the sofa.

\t Boƛƛo sis zaman bik’inosi, xan roƛa utirno.
\g 
\l After a while, the king became sick.

\t Neł zamanał nesä ʕuraw huni xecin.
\g 
\l At this time, he already went quite far.

\t Kidbä eƛin, nay yedu debi biča bayx, däz koyä heqäsi bukayxa.
\g 
\l The girl said: "From where must it be yours, it is sitting on my hand."

\t Neła eƛin, mi nazay t’or ayä.
\g 
\l He said: "How did you came here?

\t Kidbezgon rok’ƛ’or rayn, di moƛałtow yołƛin, yedu t’o roqxosi šebinon där moƛał rukayxƛin.
\g 
\l The girl thought: "I am in a dream, and what is happening here I am dreaming."

\t Bayru q’ut’oxor, Ħasanä rełimay bˤałayn roɣno aždaħzo rok’nosi, boƛƛi begirno.
\g 
\l According to the agreement they did, Hassan took his dagger out of the sheath and stabbed it into the dragon and broke him apart in the middle.

\l Don't wait for me, hide me under the brushwood and go back quickly!"

\t Zamanaƛ’aza elor äƛiruxortow q’ˤano miƛ’in bayn, riħadanix riħun.
\g 
\l After some time, two said rams came there and started to fight.

\t Xizyo žedu nasin Allahqo, qema regirƛin, harizi roqno.

\l Afterwards they all asked God: "Let it rain!"

\t Mi där quluq bodinäy, žeduqay bałgo sis šebin esanƛin”.
\g 
\l If you look after me, I will tell you a secret that the others don't know."

\l The next day, he went to the fortress together with the king's army.

\l The king called the guard and asked him: "Who has cut off the tail of this horse of mine?"

\t Raładyoz lilyox c’eruc’an resus, howža łoħron xizaz nexsiƛin, žawab teƛno žoyä babiwr.

\l "I found the bow at the sea shore, [and] that frog came behind me.", the son answered the father.

\t Ža čanya nar eƛa biynč’ey reqenyołäy gugixt’a zown.
\g 
\l The she.goat didn't know what to do anymore and escaped from the herd.

\t Nesän hudayziko sasaqtow izin gulun ħadur bodin xalmoƛ’or ičin.

\l He got up the next morning, prepared a horse and examined.

\t Eɣeni esiya eƛin, horo igorno ik’in esiran nesiq di, šebi debeƛ’ necetow q’ʷariłi yołƛin.

\l The younger brother said: "Come, I'll go to him and will ask what's wrong with him."

\t Zamanałäza nesił dandir bazarganbi c’oxno hisos urgubi q’urec’niƛ’no erno rižin bik’ix.

\l After a while, he met some merchants carrying sacks with wool on a mule.

\t Mi yik’äsi zows yołi, elotow łemu ƛäxuƛin, žawab teƛno ɣarabašä.
\g 
\l "If you had gone, you would have stayed there.", answered the servant.

\t Ražbadinä ik’in Tawadiqor eƛin, šebi deber roqä, šida mi neł rok’uɣʷeymołäy oxä.
\g 
\l Razhbadin went and said to Tavadi: "What happened to you? Why did you run away from that banquet?

\t Howži Bilq’isdä nesiq esirno, howła xizaɣorzo zamanał mi łarnokin žukłi rodäsi zowwäƛin.

\g 
\l When the boy said: "Get black!", the girl brought her hair ahead, and when he said: "Get white!", he turned her hair away from the front and threw it on her back[, saying]: "Here, I got."

\t Howžäy soder łˤora becider xanez kidbedäɣor ezäɣor di iziłinč’inäy, nesä dey meč’ beč’xosiƛin.
\g 
\l In three months after now, if I won't get up into the fortress to the king's daughter, he is going to cut off my neck."

\g 
\l He filled the jug with water and while he was coming back, the dragon shouted from behind: "Don't you come to fill [it with] water anymore! If you come, I am going to throw you into my belly and swallow you alive!"

\t Tełer ayrun yisä sida reƛ’id nełas kočori biqirno, sidenigon reƛ’id hibon bisno žek’no yedu, neła mi dey uži yołƛin eƛace.
\g 
\l Immediately after going inside, he took her hair with one hand and took a stick with the other hand and hit her until she said: "You're my son!"

\t Žigoƛ’aygon mi eli baƛ’ärinč’iƛin, esnaza aħo qaciz ruk’uzaqorno icin iħuq egirno.
\g 
\l "You're not going to cheat us again!", the brothers [said,] tied the shepherd to the bundles of wood and let him into the river.

\t Idur ža aynosi, šida mi meč’oxor akan begirno exux zowäƛin, babiwz esiya esirnosi, nesä eƛin, där babiya bodäsi wasi zows keze raqza ɣˤutkubi rodoƛin...
\g 
\l When he came home and his uncle asked: "Why have you been dying, having a noose around your neck?", he answered: "My father stated in his testament, that I have to make houses where I get to..."

\t Elaɣor bik’iƛ’oräy meža dey kiki xiräsi boqzaƛ’, mežus di eniw yoqxo, hudu meža eniya äƛiru rodoƛin.
\g 
\l When you go there, I become your mother, because you will have sucked on my breast, so do what your mother says!"

\t Užä inkar badiruce ža yežigon, neƛ henešƛin, ƛ’iri yutin.
\g 
\l The more the boy rejected, the more she insisted on "Give me the apple!"

\t Užä eƛin, baba, elur caxinč’iru šebin riqa zaħmataw ričixosi yoł.
\g 
\l The boy said: "Father, it is difficult to get a thing that is not destined for us."

\t Sida quł däder q’arza bˤeƛ’ roɣoƛin Allah ays.
\g 
\l One day God came to me: "Take the duty for the sheep away!"

\t Mi eƛo, ža čanta taraw, q’ˤuya šebin där retinanu, q’ˤuya sayɣat di bäsinč’iƛin.
\g 
\l You have to say: 'I don't want any other thing than this pocket, another present I won't take.'"

\t Elo igoza bäsuru yizir ɣˤays oreznar k’oƛinosi, gulun saɣ boqno, adäzoƛ’aygon rigu rexora maħin roƛixno.
\g 
\l There the jumped into a milky lake that they had found nearby, and the horse gut cured; its tail appeared, prettier and longer than before.

\t Xizyo t’umi maqiz muhuzaƛ’or butin, onočaƛ’orgon Okun utin.
\g 
\l Then, the pigeon turned into barley grains and Oku turned into a hen.

\t Sidaquł xanä idurno goƛ’in budumqor eƛin:
\g 
\l One day, the king called the muezzin to his home and said:

\t Elo yizi q’ˤunän rok’uɣʷeymoł bičin sasaqor ɣudi qˤaširno.
\g 
\l There the two had fun until the next morning.

\t Neła q’orolays zownƛax sis nełƛ’aygon siħiraw yacʕal.
\g 
\l That widow, so it's said, had a (female) cousin who was more cunning than her.

\t Režigon rok’u q’ʷarid roqno yisis.
\g 
\l He became even more sad...

\t Nełaƛ’osi ža ħal bukayn, yeda bełiqan tupin risno t’omceni žek’u ayace iqˤin ičin.
\g 
\l The hunter saw the condition upon her, took his rifle and waited and watched until the span-sized man came.

\t Were hoboy mi, yedu bˤeƛ’es reqenno bižin, t’ay xizor ik’iƛin, nesä nesis šeƛ’un šeƛ’urno uži egirno.
\g 
\l "Well, alright, you, lead my flock of sheep and go away!", he [said and] dressed the boy in his [own] clothings and sent him away.

\t Žigoƛ’aygon hemedurtow aɣzas xabar teqno yisir.
\g 
\l Once again he heard the birds speaking:

\t Xizyo yizi bazarganza yisił roƛƛo risno, neširu debin barusno c’ok’ini roqnäy, debi yałru maʕišat elur biča yoł, bercingo bara mi iduɣor egirnäy, ele enza łˤoran q’urec’niƛ’osi q’ay ħalalgotow deber biča yołƛin.
\g 
\l Then the merchants decided among themselves: "In the evening, if your wife makes a scandal, then your fortune will be ours, and when a good wife lets you into the home, all the articles on these three mules shall be yours."

\t Ži payda anuƛin, žan dunyalqo ik’in.
\g 
\l "Now, that was useless!", he said and also went through the world.

\t Xediw adäzay ok’äłrun, bara kušin ža ɣˤutku rosyoƛ’orno rayrno, ec’no ɣˤutku rodanix bašla bodin ustarbin begirno.
\g 
\l When her husband had gone away from her, the wife demolished that house and brought it down to the base, and she let the experts begin to build a new house.

\t Esin šebi, xecin šebi, sidaquł ʕomoyn bižin ciqaɣor qaciƛ’orƛin ʕoloqan žek’u ik’äsi zown.
\g 
\l What should I tell, what should I leave; once upon a time a young man went with a donkey into the forest to collect firewood.

\t Šibaw ruzman ɣudƛ’o nesä nesiz ulkas nasin ahli sadaqor butirxo zown.
\g 
\l Every Friday he gathered together all the people of his country.

\t Xan aynosi, doxtur išinč’ey ičin.
\g 
\l As the khan came, the doctor refused to eat.

\t Hemeł mixƛ’o, yoƛi gogan č’ˤaƛiłno, ozuri buqin baɣˤizaƛ’or, Okun, užin wˤałzoni dunyalƛ’aɣor bok’ełno.
\g 
\l After that, the middle of the meadow opened, and in the wink of an eye, Oku and his son had gone into the underworld.

\t Yedu mat’i di ciqez xaner bižix, sis miƛ’in bown min horoƛin”.
\g 
\l "I am carrying this duck to the king of the forest, go get a ram!"

\t Walla xan, di ša bodanix k’udi q’uq’iƛ’orey, elo šet’u butäsi hadambi boqzaƛ’, aqˤu kuča maħorno oqa iynč’ey howlo tełer kučis.
\g 
\l "By God, o king, while I was pressing out the grapes to make the wine, there were people who were walking around there and without me knowing took a piss in there."

\t Nesä nesiƛ’ yałru q’ʷariłi esin nełaq.
\g 
\l He told her of the sadness that was on him.

\t Ɣˤutkoxor rik’in, acno yaɣˤin tełer rezunosi, elo žedar yeɣe kid yesun.
\g 
\l They went to the house and opened the door, and when they looked inside, they found a young girl there.

\g 
\l He was too ashamed to tell, but then he told: "I played a trick on one beautiful woman, because she said she already had a husband and didn't give me her word when I asked her to marry me.

\t Nełaƛ’ yeda užin razi oqno.
\g 
\l On that also the boy agreed.

\t Elay bitor yizi łenon sadaq hunix boqno.
\g 
\l The five of them went on their way together, from there.

\t Yisägon roɣno mač’an tełäza aždaħno t’it’i-beč’no, axaza egin maħorno oqno nełas q’ˤim ret’urno kurno.
\g 
\l He took out his dagger and cut the dragon into pieces from inside, broke him apart from out of the belly, got outside and chopped off its head.

\t Kid neside igor yayrun, užä nełqay ħošos šeƛ’un roɣno mesedyos bašiqˤoy ernosi, adäyzoƛ’aygon bercinaw ža užir yukayn.
\g 
\l When the girl came to him, the boy took off her hide-clothes and put the golden ring on her, and the boy saw that she was much more beautiful than before.

\t Bilq’isdiƛ’or šakno bižirerno xanes nesi madaxozoni žek’ä, xizyo yeda qˤirič’ k’edaniłer oqno.
\g 
\l The guard let the king suspect Bilqisdi and then he began to search for the scissors.

\t Yizä xal bodinosi, bazarganzo čanta teł iyos ric’äsi, raɣˤäsitow t’aqˤ resunosi dandi yizi bužzi boqno.
\g 
\l They did an examination, found the blood-stained, open knife in the merchant's pocket and now believed them.

\t Teł iduɣorno oqno, esiyqor nesä eƛin, ačqˤaq quqix di, ħaƛanix łi neƛ därƛin.
\g 
\l He went inside into the home and said to his sister: "I am drying out because of thirst, give me some water to drink!"

\t Šebey roqsiƛin, q’orolayä šudaƛ’orno yik’in mamalayz k’onč’azaqay šeƛ’u roɣxo zown.
\g 
\l "What happened?", the widow said and went to the grave and took the clothings from the rooster's feet.

\t Sisini łäs ric’alini sikno roƛik’no, žeduqor ħaƛa teƛno.
\g 
\l He pulled out a skin filled with water and gave it to them to drink.

\t Ža bix yałza mečoƛ’or aynosi, rexorani bixiz ɣˤuč’ä eƛix teqno, yisi žek’us ʕantłi rukayxana mežur, barus ʕadlun boqinč’ey, nesä nesił xizaz rexʷadanix ħonƛ’ay bˤeƛ’no rown nexxoƛin.
\g 
\l When he came to the place where the grass was, he heard the longest blade of grass say: "Don't you see the ... of this man? He can't control his wife, but brings sheep down from the mountain to slaughter them after himself."

\t Däz beženi ɣˤʷačulis madaxortow ɣˤʷačni teqzaƛ’ tełxorkin yik’inč’uƛin.
\g 
\l Because I heard the chewing of my old goat at the door, I didn't go inside.

\t Xizyo diwanbegä ħukmun beč’no, žeduq riyrno, Bilq’isdin hečker yičirno, ža cucixace eč’ibi kuro nełaƛ’orƛin.

\l Then the judge made a decision and explained to them: "Let her stand up and throw pebbles onto her until she is burried under them."

\t Łaymoƛ’or aynosi, Ismaʕil nełde puħor k’oƛin.
\g 
\l When Ismail came to, he run to her side.

\t Rˤałayn rodin, at’no beqa ħolimoƛ’ roɣno, Alimaħama čardaħä q’ˤidan ičin ezun ičäsi zown.
\g 
\l Having done the threshing, Alimagomed put the wheat on a mat in the sun, sat down on a balcony and was looking around.

\t Xaner ža šebi yałru iyn anu.
\g 
\l The khan did not recognise him.

\t Neł q’ʷariłiƛ’ cek’i bukaynosi, ʕomoyä eƛin, iħäy łäs yic’no muš yownäy, begiranƛin.
\g 
\l When the donkey saw the sad goat kid, he said: "If you bring a pot filled with water from the river, I'll let you in."

\t Howlotow yisä ceyes lel yik’urno.
\g 
\l There he burned the eagle's feather.

\t Kid ʕuraw ɣˤaɣˤu yizin.
\g 
\l The girl got very happy.

\t Łaxtow di nexanƛin?”.
\g 
\l To whom shall I come?"

\t Xexoyzas eniya šebi deber retinƛin žaq esirnosi, p’es anusi ičin.
\g 
\l When the chicks' mother asked the boy: "What do you want?", he remained silent.

\t Sis ħon xecin, q’ano ħon xecin, łˤono ħon xecin yeda q’ˤuya ħukmatyołxor ok’ełno.
\g 
\l He left one mountain behind himself, left two mountains behind himself, left three mountains behind himself and came into another country.

\t Xanä kid yegiranƛin nesił q’ut’in boyn, ža uži kid yuyxor yutiranix egirno.
\g 
\l The king agreed with him to give him his daughter, and the boy began to turn her back into a real girl.

\t Oqnäyƛin, eƛin qˤayz xexoyä, di eniw goƛ’an bik’an, deber rätiru łinałäyn di nełaq esanƛin.

\l "If that's the case," said the rabbit's young, "I will go to call mother and you will tell her about what you want."

\t Xizyo zeyä neła nełas ozurabi roɣno rac’no.
\g 
\l Then the bear took out his own eyes and ate them.

\t Nełas siskin urɣel boynanu bat’iyaw sisxolizoni q’orolaz užä.
\g 
\l The son of the other widow who was alone, did not have any sorrow.

\t Debez eniwq baqru hunarä däq boqxanuƛin, aždaħä žedur miƛ’i bexayn.
\g 
\l "Your mother's talent isn't mine", the dragon said and slaughtered a ram for them.

\t Suƛƛi sider sis bukayrun yizis roƛ’i boqxo.
\g 
\l Immediately when they saw each other, they fell in love.

\g 
\l Before your friendship dies, rather we would die!"

\t Q’ˤogce bix eqersiyołi, q’ˤida äčiza kokoru qˤiƛci roqxosiƛin.

\l If one had put a bale of hay to where one sits, it would become a soft pillow.

\t Mekoq bexux yałru k’et’u sosi bik’in miƛ’eƛ’ c’oxno, xizyogon isƛ’o łeɣin.

\g 
\l "So go, give him a name and come back!", said the bear.

\t Howlaytow bitor adäz bikorin, xizaz kidno hunix boqno bikorzo iduɣorƛin bik’in.

\l From then on, the snake went ahead with the daughter following it, until it came to the snake's house.

\t Dey zikru netikin łiyxosianu.

\l "My recitation never ends.

\l They have never had a such delicious soup before, so that evening the mother and the son ate good.

\t Yeda uži žeduł teł rok’u q’uq’ix ik’a retinč’ey ik’ix zown.

\l "Just when it gets hot, these calves will run home", the shepherd answered them.

\g 
\l When he had escaped from there, he threw the cow's hide away and went home.

\l "What are you going to do to me anyway?", thought the bear and waited laughing.

\t Neside sadaqosin nesä łiboƛ’ beɣurxo zown, hemediw q’uwataw uži oqxo zown ža.
\g 
\l He defeated all his peers in wrestling, and became such a strong boy.

\l "Now I will come to you, if you give me that lute of yours."

\l And the hunter also took one khinkali out of the pan and put a piece of meat next to it.

\t Neła quł užiq siskin besuron biqinanu, hudu haq’un quqa ƛexun.
\g 
\l On that day, the boy didn't get any fish, so the family remained hungry.

\l After some time the king got cured.

\l The king died very soon, then.

\l Finally, only the donkey and the calf were working.

\l After she came home, the husband's mother said to her: "Strike the jug against the wall." and she struck it against the wall.

\t Xanä wazires meč’no beč’no, t’akan nesiqor yayäruni žax, ixiw bertenno bodin, kidno yegirno.

\l Razhbadin said: "My friend, I've come to ask for your daughters hand."

\l "Where did you hide?" the father asked.

\l The father gathered everything together and went into the village.

\l Before a long time had passed, his father died and afterwards his mother died, and the son remained alone.

\t Sida zamanałäy, eženi esiya eɣeni esiw zeru łek’ira egirno.
\g 
\l After a while, the eldest brother sent the youngest brother to stir the bouza.

\t Sida quł maħorno oqno uži nesicetow sida žaƛ’no iħanayn, yisiq nesis mecu q’ˤažun.

\l One day the boy went outside and had a fight with a peer, and he dislocated his hand.

\t Mi äƛiru roži t’ubazi rodinč’uƛin, xanä yeženi esiw xizor yoxirno.
\g 
\l "You didn't keep your word!" said the king and chased the oldest sister back.

\l The village people were very pleased with her.

\t Yisägon bisno iduɣorno bižin, aɣzaqozoni bak’imar begirno.
\g 
\l He took it, carried it home and put it into the hen coop.

\g 
\l When they came under the window, he shouted "Uneyzat!", but there was no response.

\t Xabar anuzo hut’er, k’al yäsruce kiri bäči.

\l "The silent mouth will get the reward, just like in the fast.

\l Those three brothers were proposed to the same girl.

\l Neither does one know what harm they did to him.

\l Tsighruk, however, crossed a river and escaped.

\l And so the two brothers escaped from punishment, due to their cleverness.

\t Elo sida azbarya teł yisir žek’u esun, ixiw ƛoħon c’idoƛ’ erno, simildi raħirxo.
\g 
\l There, inside a palace, he found a man who put a big pan onto the fire and cooked corn.

\t Bełiqanä roč k’ek’erłin, yizä bayru q’ut’oxor, ža izirnoanu.

\l When the hunter moved the rope, they - according to the agreement they come upon - didn't lift him up.

\t Yeda rigzaxay t’ay äk’inč’iƛin, boc’ä harizi rodin, rigza ħalał qema regirƛin.

\t Elaz ik’iƛ’oräy, yisir ɣˤanazas roži teqno, daƛ’ gurħizi oqxosi žek’utow ana t’ozaƛin.

\l Inside the house, she found a table set with the best food.

\g 
\l Finally, when they looked into the sky, they saw him hiding in the sky, riding on the eagle's back.

\t Sida quł q’ˤanon esnabi urɣizi boqno xanez iday micxir bok’ek’anƛin.
\g 
\l One day the two brothers thought: "We'll steal money from the king's home!"

\t Ħonƛ’or baynosi, sida beƛ’q’ˤa sasaqor oc’ino ʕazar ƛeli bodin.
\g 
\l When they arrived on the mountain, one sheep gave birth to ten thousand lambs in the morning.

\l After he came to that plain, the ram's blood spots ended; when he turned around, he fell onto the earth/world below, and on the roof of a house.

\t Xizyo baɣmaɣorno ik’in, ɣunoƛ waħo q’ˤida ičin zown ičäsi, Allahä sis sabaw yoynč’i diƛin.

\l The wedding was set up and the hunter's son married that girl.

\l "When I blow, you will turn into the louse. Afterwards you will hide youself inside the girl's forelock. Before she go home, jump down and I will turn you back to the boy."

\t Nesiqosi šeƛ’u łiyän rižin, ža howlotow adoru ƛexasi dowdäɣor nexa oqinč’ey.

\l And the water carried his clothes away, he remained naked there and could not come to you.

\l In the morning they found gold in the trough, where it was tied.

\l They slowly made their fortune, and one day an irreversible disease hit them and the father and the mother died, so the six brothers remained orphans.

\l "Very good!" he agreed and went hiding himself.

\t Užä nesir rätiru šebin esinosi, zeyä yeda ʕoƛno ħonno xecin bitaza sasugani ciqa yałruni imxa tełxor ižin.

\l After the hunter's son has told what he wanted, the bear took him to the cave behind the seven mountains in the dark forest.

\t Ader zamanał sida eniws roda risa šebin koƛ’ixanusi kid zown.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there was a mother who had a daughter, who didn't understand how to do things.

\t Necetow žedu ƛ’iri butizaƛ’, yedan razi oqxo.

\l Because they insisted so much, he also agreed.

\l The boy whom the people called "the dumb one", gave his wooden stick away for five camels packed with the prettiest clothings, then he got on his way to the village.

\t Becurinč’ey di täƛru biłetow däqorno meža hibo bayrsi yołi, din mežus mežuqor rutirno kinaw šebin neƛa zowsƛin.

\l After that, no one came to the father's graveyard anymore.

\g 
\l On this very day, the boy was brought to him.

\t Zownƛax, zown anuƛax sis giħono xan.

\l It talked in human language and said: "Don't chase me away from here; pull out three hairs from my tail and go home; on a day that you are in trouble, after you burned them, I  will help you to regain your strength."

\t Elus t’o raq’ˤu kidbabi łiyrsi yiła aždaħäƛin, - esin yiła.
\g 
\l That dragon ate up many of our daughters", she said.

\l One travelling man, [saying] "Take and eat it!", pulled out a leaf from the tree and gave it to him.

\t Xizaɣor bazarganä uži muk’urno oyn, nesä nesiz ƛirbadäɣor bik’inosi, elo sisxoli ɣˤanabi yesun.

\l Finally the merchant persuaded the boy and when they went to his own comrade, they found a single woman.

\t Q’ˤuna äƛiru ɣudƛ’on neširu kecno äčizar xanez užis hemełatow ɣˤutkazay eč’i caƛin yayrno.

\t Elaygon bitor ik’iƛ’oräy, yisir sis ħalaq’aw gulu besun.

\t Elo bˤeƛ’a sidä sidqor eƛix teqno, were, howži gušiwt’ani sida puƛ’aɣor, ƛ’ariyawt’ani sideni puƛ’aɣor roqƛin.

\t Žeduq ža moƛugon esis yołi, di yałruxor ƛexa zowsƛin.
\g 
\l Had I told them this dream instead, I would have remained what I was.

\g 
\l Aliqilich did not agree.

\t Kaɣat koyär yäsruntow, babiya uži egirno, debi mi esiwn yexurno, nełas rok’u däq rukaranix raƛin.
\g 
\l As soon as the father took the letter in his hand, he said to his son: "Kill your sister, and bring me her heart to show it to me!"

\t Hudayziko onoču mamalaył xizay biynč’ey ciqaɣor bik’in.

\l The next day, the hen secretly followed the rooster into the forest.

\t Ža kid mi däx yegira yayƛin, yisä Muħamadqor eƛin.
\g 
\l "You must marry this girl off to me!", he said to Muhammad.

\g 
\l One day he turned into a horse, and I led him to the market and sold him.

\l All's well that ends well.

\t Bazarganä q’ˤunerno yic’xot’a t’akan et’nosi, nesä ħaƛux zown, yiła enduräz t’asmaɣor yiħurxo zown.

\l After the merchant poured a glass full for each of them, he drank, and she poured it into the washbowl in the same way.

\t Sida quł yizä yeda režin rayn ɣurox egirno.
\g 
\l One day, ...(???).

\l Without saying another word, Mountain~Hero exchanged the horse with the old man.

\l He got older and when the time has come to die, he gave his testament to the son: "When I have died, you build a house where you want, but don't marry a woman except for one being black and white, be she long or short.

\t Didurnokin eɣeni esiws ħal bayrxo zownanu neła, kodi begirinč’eygon yedan zank’izin oqno ičäsi zown.

\t Were, were, esoƛin, baru ƛ’iri yutin.
\g 
\l "Well well, tell me!", the wife insisted.

\t Xizyo diwanbegä ħukmun beč’no, ža eč’izad yexursiƛin.
\g 
\l Then the judge made the decision that she was to be killed by stoning."

\t Howži min barun ʕaƛaɣor bik’in.
\g 
\l You and your wife go into the village now.

\t Puräza barun hokomƛ’on zown ik’ixƛax.
\g 
\l Apparently he was riding on a carriage next to his wife.

\t Uži mažgityaɣor keca ik’ixƛin oqnosi, yedu ƛ’iri yutin ƛirba kecanix mažgityaɣor egiranix elude lamusaw šebin yołƛin.
\g 
\l When the boy was about to go to the mosque to sleep, she insisted: "It is a shame for us to send a comrade to the mosque for him to sleep!"

\t Užä guluq esirno, yedu šebi šebinƛin.
\g 
\l The boy asked the horse: "What thing is that?!"

\t ʕOloqza esirno:
\g 
\l The people asked:

\t Xizyogon žukani halmaɣä eƛin, deber bišʷa retinäy, roɣno mi där sis ozuri neƛƛin.
\g 
\l Then the bad friend said: "If you want food, take one eye out and give it to me!"

\t Xizyogon xanä dey oz bišroƛin eƛinosi, žoyä meɣyoqorno eƛin žedun bišerno.
\g 
\l Then, when the king said: "Let my army eat!", the boy said [it] to his udder and let them eat.

\t Łˤono äƛiruni bełiqa qˤaƛin, insan esunäy roži roɣo, bełi besunäy ela c’eruc’a caƛixƛin.
\g 
\l The third hunter shouted: "If you are a human, say something; if you are an animal, we will shoot you with the bow!"

\t Eɣeni esiwq xanä deber łinax riyä kut’yoƛ’aza puƛ’aza nełaƛ’ ƛ’iri nuci zawrułiƛin esirnosi, nesä eƛin:
\g 
\l When the king asked the younger brother, how he knew that it had honey on its right side, he said:

\t Howži yeda q’ebedes uži ƛ’irir aynosi, zeyän, ziran yisiq harizi rodin howziri łˤonon: gulun, ħurženyabin, k’ukno eluƛ’ riłixor rułirƛin.
\g 
\l Now that the son of the smith came, the bear and the fox asked him: "Share these three items: the horse, the bags and the cap among us equally!"

\t ƛˤebaƛ’aza žedur uži odin.
\g 
\l After a year, they got a son.

\t Xanä nesiq esirno, didur debeq hawšinaw šebin roda k’ʷeze roqäƛin.
\g 
\l The king asked him: "How could you do so many things?!"

\t Aždaħƛ’or batiruni bikori nexxo yoł, madazaħ räsuru šinaw šebin neła rac’xosi yołƛin!”
\g 
\l A snake that turned into a dragon is coming and it will eat up everything it finds!"

\l They heard the beaten henchman say: "The henchmen lied to you, they filled that water from the place where the siblings live; couldn't these children perhaps be yours?"

\t Xizyogon nesä dowqor ħoyä tełäy magalu boɣoƛin eƛinosi, hemedurtow sosi mi boɣo xizyo di boɣanƛin eƛo.

\l Then, when he asks you: 'Take the bread out of the oven!', say likewise: 'First you take it out, then I will take it out!'

\t Žedu q’ˤunesno daʕba boqno, elo tełsi mesed boƛi-bok’łinč’ey.
\g 
\l These two disputed because they could not divide the gold equally.

\t Užä ža ragin łiyrxo rukaynosi, bazarganä yeda xizor oxirno.
\g 
\l When he saw that the boy was eating it up, the merchant chased him.

\t Yeda marɣalyos k’icu yołalini debi uži yołƛin, eƛin neła nełaz xediwƛ’or bašan boyn ukarno.
\g 
\l And he is your son with the pearl tooth.", she said and pointed her finger to her husband.

\t Sida quł užä eniwqay zap’ana hisos k’apyan bisno, žan t’aħin, c’eruc’a rodin.
\g 
\l One day the son took a strong wool thread by his mother, strained it and made a bow.

\t Łaz ƛ’ˤuƛ’o c’eruc’a c’oxxo, hemeła ɣˤutkay kid yowa yołƛin.
\g 
\l Whose roof you hit with the bow, the daughter from that house you will marry.

\g 
\l Bring me a dragon's young to guard me; I heard somewhere there there is a dragon and beside it three youngs."

\t Hemełƛ’o Beqes ʕUneyzatä kidbez q’ˤimƛ’ay pardagi roɣno caƛin eƛin, yedu yoł mesedyos žežu yołalini debi kidƛin.
\g 
\l Thereupon Sun's Uneyzat threw away the scarf off the girl's head and said: "She is your daughter with the golden ponytail.

\t Nełaz q’ˤimqon lagiqnotown c’i łeɣin.
\g 
\l Its head and its body caught fire.

\t Sasaqosi zira eƛin: ƛa ħažƛ’aɣor rik’an q’anon sadaqƛin.”
\g 
\l In the morning, the fox said: "Come, let's go on hajj (pilgrimage) together."

\t ʕAƛoz raʕalłixorgon baynosiƛin, eƛin babiya, elude dandir šuša žek’u ižin bik’ixozo xalq’imoqgon Aħmadä esirsi, eƛ’iyä yeda žek’u exasi, yagi žiƛboyäƛin.
\g 
\l "When we came to the edge of the village," said the father, "Akhmed asked the people that were coming towards us carrying a man to bury him: 'Has this man died last year or this year?'."

\t Xizyogon esiwn č’ariłno.
\g 
\l Then his sister woke up.

\t Oč’ira mučaris bahana besun,
\g 
\l She found the excuse for the nine cumin cakes,

\t Neła quł sasaqosigon esnabi madaħor boqnosi, eɣeni esiw qˤabani guluƛ’no zown, q’ˤuya šeƛ’un šeƛ’un, yaraɣno lagiqor kurno ik’in.
\g 
\l The next morning when the brothers went outside, the young brother rode the black horse, put on different clothes, threw a weapon around his body and rode off.

\t Zeyä ža neła nełdäɣor yižin.
\g 
\l The bear led her to himself.

\t Mekodäsin, akiłäsin, tatu bexasin yeda elo tełxor ik’in.
\g 
\l Being hungry, tired and at the end of his powers, he went inside.

\t Elo yizar boc’as berten besun.
\g 
\l There they found the wedding of wolves.

\t Q’orolayz xabaryoƛ’ay yiłar riyn neł ʕaƛa teł nasin sida bečedaw žek’uz bertenyołer boqxosi yałrułi.
\g 
\l From the widow's telling, she knew that everyone in this village was going to the wedding of a rich man.

\t Ža nediw tamašałi rukaynosi, acno yaɣˤin, idurno ik’in, pečmaɣor łoħros qal kurno.
\g 
\l Having seen such a wonder, he opened the door, went home and threw the frog's skin into the oven.

\t Howži tełxorno goƛ’in, neła nełaz xediwqor yiła eƛin, howła xizaɣorzo zamanał deber baqru q’ʷariłiłäy mi däq esoƛin.
\g 
\l Now she invited her own husband in and said: "Tell me about the bad things that had happened to you lately?"

\t Ža debi ƛe didiw zown?
\g 
\l "What kind of bridge was that of yours?

\t Sis isno adäz boc’no egirno yisä Muħamad, bexayn žan, ħalalawni reƛ mežan rac’no, ħaramawni där raƛin.
\g 
\l He let Muhammad drive a bull ahead: "Slaughter it, and [y'all] eat the permitted meat, and bring the prohibited [meat] to me!"

\t Xizyo babiwzno yedu kid rok’ƛ’or yaysƛax.
\g 
\l Afterwards also the father remembered that daughter.

\t Nagaħ ža riyrinč’inäy dowde dandir di ƛˤori boda yołƛin.
\g 
\l "If you don't find it out, I will start a war against you."

\t Sasaqosi maħor oqƛ’oräy, eɣeni esiw gondaɣor ʕoƛ’un.
\g 
\l In the morning when he went outside, the young brother fell into the hole.

\t Zownƛax zown anuƛax onočun, mamalayn.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there was a hen and a rooster.

\t Nesis haq’u bełiq’ay bišxo zown.
\g 
\l His family made a living from the hunting.

\t Neła quł sasaq, esiw bełiƛ’ ik’inosi, ža q’orolay žigon yayn k’oƛin idur.
\g 
\l The next morning when the brother had gone hunting, that widow ran back to their home once again.

\t Bilq’isdä dibirqor eƛin, mežur di ʕaƛos xanłi rodan, žamaʕatyo di äƛiru łˤono šebin rodanix ƛ’iri risnäyƛin.
\g 
\l Bilqisdi said to the imam: "I will take over the kingship over the village for you all, if the population does the three things that I say."

\t Neširu, sasiłnosi, ʕomoybi yałru rečuxor boc’i bayn.
\g 
\l In the evening, after it got dark, the wolf came to the cattleshed where the donkeys were.

\t Yedu risxozo žek’uqor mi eƛoƛin, eƛin kidbä nełqor, debeq yiłas bašiqˤoy baha bäzinč’iƛin.
\g 
\l "Say to the person who wants to buy it:" the girl told her, "'You won't affort the price.'

\t Babiwr kidno, esiwr esiyn, xedyor barun, žar eniwn č’agu yoqnoƛax.
\g 
\l For the father his daughter, for the brother his sister, for the husband his wife and for the son his mother was alive.

\t Hemeł zamanał xanes roƛno.
\g 
\l At this time the king got sick.

\t Xizyo xanä naysinän xabaryabin regirno, kaɣatyabin caxno doxturbi goƛ’in.
\g 
\l After that, the king sent the news and wrote letters everywhere and invited doctors.

\t Elaygon bitor čanyabi k’edix ik’iƛ’oräy, neside dandir čarman ricin nexxo ziru č’aq’ˤin.
\g 
\l While going away from there searching the goats, a fox with a turban ran into him.

\t Yisiz bertenyołer xanno, nesä saɣ adiruni ža nesis užin, žasgon ža barun yayn.
\g 
\l The khan and his son, who was cured by this doctor, came to the marriage with his wife.

\t Oƛixatow žek’u oƛixxo zownanu.
\g 
\l But there was no such man at all.

\t Q’ˤimde sadaq lagan šušin, eɣeni esiya rok’un hiƛirno.
\g 
\l The young brother buried the body together with the head and calmed down.

\t Suƛitow eženi esiwn ayrno, gulun bayrno.
\g 
\l And it immediately brought his big brother and the horse.

\t Insan mi esunäy däz kʷayär horo, yałi, eli maxsaryoƛ’ bisinč’ey, xizor bik’iƛin”.
\g 
\l "If you are a human, come into my hand, or else this joke won't bluff us and we'll go back"

\t Yeženir barkalan bodin, yizi keca bik’in.
\g 
\l He thanked the old woman and they went to sleep.

\t Ela elus halmaɣłi rexura raynč’i.
\g 
\l We mustn't destroy our friendship.

\t Hemełƛ’o bečedawni žek’a eƛin, mi dey kid saɣ yodinäy, maharno erno debex ža di yegiran, retinäy boƛi bok’no dey maʕišat neƛanƛin.
\g 
\l Afterwards the rich man suggested, "If you cure my daughter, I will set up the wedding and if you want, I will give you one half of my fortune."

\t Q’ˤano äƛirugon ɣudƛ’o, buq bayru mixƛ’o xediya eƛin, žaqˤułgon dunyalkinwa yedu qˤašixanuƛin.
\g 
\l On the second day, at the time the sun came out, the husband said: "And today even the world doesn't seem to dawn at all."

\t Yezunosi yiłar bercinaw, gelmač’u, ozuri bic’äsi uži ukayn nełał adäzarno oqno ičäsi.
\g 
\l She looked around and saw a boy with handsome, round eyes having come in front of her.

\t C’ik’iwtow humerno, šeƛ’un xiszi rodin, nełdäɣorno ik’in esirno, ɣamas yodixosi žek’u etinaƛin.
\g 
\l He changed his entire face and his clothes, went to him [the dragon] and asked if he wanted a man that makes boxes.

\t Tawadiz harimoxor Ražbadinä nesirtow hič’č’a eɣeni užin xecin.
\g 
\l According to Tavadi's request, Razhbadin left the youngest son to him.

\t Neła žaqor eƛin, t’ay ik’iƛ’orey, deber bˤeƛ’xo aħo äsu.
\g 
\l She said to the boy: "When you go away from here, you will find a shepherd with a flock of sheep.

\t Yeda uži, bišʷannan rok’ƛ’ay šuƛ’in, q’ˤuna anƛ’ima hunix ik’in.
\g 
\l The boy forgot about food entirely and went on his way for two weeks.

\t Igtow q’ˤimłerno aɣˤun babiw idur ayn.
\g 
\l The father came home very puzzled.

\t Howži aħyabin rˤoƛ’urno xanes uži yeda ičix zawru mečoƛ’or ayn.
\g 
\l Now, the prince hang his head and went to the place where he was living.

\t Boc’a rigtow rˤuƛ’no.
\g 
\l The wolves were very afraid.

\t Howži bełiqanes ʕuraw rok’un raq’ˤiłno, roda šebinon koƛ’inč’ey ƛexun yeda.
\g 
\l Now the hunter got very upset and remained not knowing what to do.

\t Hemeła ɣudƛ’ot’a q’ˤuya ulkał ičixosi Muħamadƛin ci yołäsi muʔmin žek’u elor aħnayx zown.
\g 
\l On each of those days, a pious man who lived in another country came walking there.

\t Sida puƛ’aza užibi, sida puƛ’aza žeduz annazaqar annabin rutirno kidbabi.
\g 
\l On one side the boys had gathered and on one side, knee next to knee, gathered the girls.

\t Ža kusaq eƛin łiyzaƛ’ortow, ʕomoyä ħoʕni rizirno.
\g 
\l Even before the beardless man had finished saying this, the donkey gave out a shout.

\t Sasaqgon miƛ’i šudaƛ’or ciyo raganix bayn.
\g 
\l And on the next day, the ram came to the graveyard to lick the salt again.

\t Šet’ur ezuzaƛ’, sis ƛ’iri yałru as taraw rukayxanuƛax elo.
\g 
\l When looking around, he didn't see anything else there than the sky that was above him.

\t Eɣeni esiws c’eruc’a resatow resux zownanu.
\g 
\l The younger brother's bow didn't find anything at all.

\t Elay cołizin roqno nasin halmaɣbi rizin zeyƛ’ c’oxno.
\g 
\l Then all the friends united, got up and pounced on the bear.

\t Idur yaynosi, užigon kecäsi esunosi, asoqtow yitin.
\g 
\l When she came home, she found the boy sleeping and was in seventh heaven.

\t Ža uži zey iłetown aq’ˤiłxo ik’ix zowno.
\g 
\l That boy grew up just like the bear.

\t Xedya mežay bitor zigara bizira baybik bodin.
\g 
\l The husband began to moan from his mattress.

\t Yedu kidgon Ražbadinqor baqru ʕišq’ud, netey yedu berten bodixƛin, iduɣor yik’ixosi hunin šuƛ’in qˤilo yok’ełxo.
\g 
\l The girl was so in love with Razhbadin, and because she prepared that marriage, she forgot the way home and got lost.

\t Žedu c’aq’ yaziqłiƛ’ zown.
\g 
\l They were very poor.

\t Eženä yeda yisä yisir užiłun xecin.
\g 
\l The old man adopted him as his own son.

\t Hoboygon žar ʕoƛnontow čara bexun.
\g 
\l Now the boy totally ran out of possibilities.

\t Ha hoboy, dey mesedyos saħno, t’asno, reƛ’iqoyn, pandurno neƛƛin”.
\g 
\l "Well now, give me back my sah of gold, my washbowl, my glove and my lute."

\t Sisgon mołin neła, elorno ezun xizor ik’iƛ’oräygon, nesä debeq esär, šebi deber t’ay neƛanƛin.
\g 
\l She taught him another thing: "While you go back after having looked, he will ask you what he shall give to you.

\t Kidbä his xuxiƛ’oräy, nełaƛ’ yałru aq’ˤuban, q’ʷariłin bukaynosi, yisiq reže qoqoƛu regin.
\g 
\l While the girl was combing the wool, he laughed loudly, when he saw the torture and sadness that was upon her.

\t Hudayzikogon neširu xanä baɣmoxor oƛosini uži egirno.
\g 
\l Next day in the evening the khan sent his middle son to the garden.

\t Nesän hemedurtow esirno užiq, ža ziys ħoši teƛxanaƛin.
\g 
\l He asked the boy likewise: "Aren't you going to sell that cow hide?"

\t Zeyä žedaqor eƛin, hemeł beženi ʕaƛa łi anuƛax.
\g 
\l The bear said to them: "It's said that there's no water in this big village.

\t Suƛƛi yeda Ismaʕil ozyoł łic’axrun, t’it’in bešerxotow bižix zown yisä xanes oz.
\g 
\l And immediately that Ismail joined that army and fell, cut down and took out the king's army.

\t Hemełƛ’o ƛ’irir ayn k’oƛin kot’u yexorani eženi žek’u.
\g 
\l On that moment appeared the old man with the long beard.

\t Žeda isno hokomƛ’o ħaliłäsi xan eqerno.
\g 
\l They took the drunken king and put him onto the carriage.

\t Moƛał rukayru šebinon hemedurtow eluq riqixosi anuƛin, Pat’imatä žedu xizor boxirno.
\g 
\l "Likewise we cannot get something that we saw in a dream.", Fatima said and chased them back.

\t Nesä žawab teƛno:
\g 
\l He answered:

\t Žeda besurozaƛ’ay ʕumru boyx zown.
\g 
\l They were living from fishing.

\g 
\l And why the heck has this fallen down?

\t Izin užä neł imyoq ħobo bok’nosi, nazay eƛa riynč’ey reƛ’iqoy rˤoƛ’un.
\g 
\l When he got up and kicked the pole, a glove fell down he didn't know from where.

\t K’uruč’ k’eč’ ɣudi rocu, buq bay.
\g 
\l All's well that ends well.

\t Asoq itix qazaq, halmaɣä ža xabar esinosi.
\g 
\l The Georgian was on cloud nine, when his friend told him the story.

\t Yoƛozoni esiya eƛin, däqor at’es sis saħ neƛnäy, debez ozyortow ʕeze roqace magalabi rodan diƛin.

\g 
\l Sun's Uneyzat didn't agree to this and gave the golden chair to the girl that used to be tied to the pole, the silver one to the boy, the copperone to the girl and the wooden one she took for herself.

\t Gulu bišan begirno puƛ’or ʕoƛ’unosi, yeda moƛa iqirxo.

\t Q’orolayä nełaqor eƛin, deber žukłi rodanix xalq’i urɣizi boqäsi yołƛin.

\l The next morning, the father said: "Bring alot of pilaw to everyone in the village tomorrow, or else I will kill you."

\t Eɣeni esiwq xanä, däz šadał aqˤuros maħ nazay boqa bayxƛin esirnosi, nesä eƛin:

\l When the king asked the younger brother, how it came that his wine smells like urine, he said:

\l "Show it!", [they said and] when they insisted heavily, the man lying on the burka said: "When you hold my cap while I will go away and come back, I will show you the thing that is here."

\t ƛ’irir ik’in sis xexoyn biqirno, et’un guluƛ’orno k’oƛin, sosi čuret’ bok’no.

\l He came closer, grabbed one young dragon, jumped onto his horse and cracked the whip once.

\t Esiya eƛin, rigutow ħadurłi rodaniƛäy ħonƛ’ay bˤeƛ’ rowa ik’an diƛin.
\g 
\l His brother said: "Because this has to be well prepared, I'll go bring a flock of sheep down from the mountain."

\t Sis zown eniwn nełasgon łˤono kidno.
\g 
\l Once there was a mother who had three daughters.

\t Bełiqanqor ezun mažgitägon dibirno zown ičäsi, yeda dice žaqˤuł kʷat’izi oqxoƛin.
\g 
\l And in the mosque the imam was waiting for the hunter, [saying:] "How late he is today!"

\t ʕIšq’a halag adiru ʕoloqan žek’u darsimoƛ’orä reʕizi oqxo.
\g 
\l The young man, being excited by love, how could he have time for lessons?!

\t Haqan bogurno tełer ezun elo čanyazas ruɣutow rukaynč’izaƛ’, nesä ža zey begirno.
\g 
\l He let him gape, looked into his mouth, and because he didn't see any footprints of the goats there, he let that bear go.

\t C’irduxno, nesis esnabin buqˤełno nełaƛ’ bezun bičäsi zown.
\g 
\l Tsirdukh and his brothers hid and then were looking.

\t Miƛ’i boƛäxrun, et’un guluƛ’orno k’oƛin oqno xizay.
\g 
\l Just when the ram appeared, he jumped onto his horse and began to ride behind it.

\t Ža xabarno teqno obiwn, užin bezanixƛin bik’inosi, yisir suƛƛi yukayruntow yiyn yedu yisis baru yałru.

\l Having heard of this story, the father and his son went to have a look and he immediately knew when seeing her, that it was his wife.

\l After he has seized the most beatiful one, the guards caught him and asked, "Where did you come from and why?"

\t Xizyo žeduł xizay bik’ix zawru ɣˤʷayn bexurno, nełas rok’un rižin ik’in babiwder, di esiw yexursiƛin eƛanix.

\t K’oƛin yedu yäk’iru, q’ˤuriƛ’orno izin meč’oxor q’aq’at’u kurxo esun.

\l He was also doing other work that he could get.

\l The imam began to read out the Qur'ân loudly.

\l When they came to eat dinner there, the brothers found that man there with his two hands supporting him and sitting over his food.

\t Elo teł min uqˤno, ža ɣamasno hokomƛ’o eqerno, di xanes ez yałza mečoƛ’ar ik’an.
\g 
\l I will hide you inside it, put that box onto a carriage and go to the place where the king's fortress is.

\t Tełxor yeda äk’iruntow, gulu begirnon xecin kidbä, xizyo qˤaƛin babiwqor, gulu boxin bik’isƛin.
\g 
\l Right after he went inside, the girl let the horse go and then shouted to her father: "The horse has run away!"

\t Bisno žoyä c’udani heneš teƛno.
\g 
\l The boy took a red apple and gave it to her.

\t Dibirno goƛ’in, nuʕbin bayrno, neła quł neširutown Ismaʕilä ʕArabuzan yown.
\g 
\l They called the mullah, let witnesses come and on that very day in the same evening, Ismail married Arabuzan.

\t Neła qaciz ruk’uqorno icin iħułxor kurxosi yałrułin čuqˤno, ža qˤaƛanada oqno, di ža uži anu, di bˤeƛ’xosi aħo yołƛin.
\g 
\l They tied him to that bundle of wood and when he noticed that they were about to throw him into the river, he started yelling: "I am not the boy, I am a shepherd with a flock of sheep!"

\t Xizyo yizi uynon xanez ɣˤutka tełxor boqno.
\g 
\l Then the four of them went into the king's house.

\t Xanä yisił adäza sual erno, kid yižiƛ’oräy bodač’in berten, nagaħ yoxiraniƛ’or yaynäy, hemełƛ’o bodanƛin.
\g 
\l The king asked him a question: "While I am going to marry the girl, I will not make a wedding; if I have to chase her away, I will do it."

\t Ixdax, isi yecinosi, nasin ciqes, posu yiła maħor regirno.
\g 
\l In spring, after the snow had thawed, she let all the wild animals out.

\t Nełƛ’osi baq’ˤu zaman bik’izaƛ’ortow, łox äƛirugon acmoq deqƛin.
\g 
\l And alot more time after that, it knocked on the door a third time.

\t Xanez užä nesix esiw yegirnoƛax.
\g 
\l The prince married his sister off to him, it is said.

\t Zownƛax, zown anuƛax eniwn užin.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there was a mother and her son.

\t Elay bitor išno-utin ik’inosi, hemełtow azbaryoxor ayn.
\g 
\l He ate and from there he went further and came to the same palace.

\t Neła harizi rodin, habsaʕat maħorno yoqno yayan diƛin.
\g 
\l She pleaded: "I'll get outside and come back!"

\t Nexanƛin yigtow yedu kid ƛ’iri yutinosi, žoyä pandur teƛno ičin yiłar.
\g 
\l "I will come", the girl insisted very much, and the boy gave her the lute.

\t Sasaq nexno maħlay xanqor qˤaƛo mi, c’ik’iw raładyołäy besurobin roqno, žeda debi räƛiru šebin rac’noƛin.
\g 
\l "Come tomorrow and shout from the court tomorrow, that all the fish got out of the sea and ate what you planted."

\t Elus q’ut’i zownč’a där rätiru šebin sadaq rižanix regira, din där rätiru šebin hokomƛ’o ersiƛin.
\g 
\l "Didn't we have an agreement so you let me carry all the things I wanted? I put the things I wanted onto the carriage."

\t Xanä bełiquz žaqor eƛin, sida ezä teł aɣi yołƛin teqxo, där howžan bown horo miƛin.
\g 
\l The king said to the hunter' son, "Inside a fortress there is a bird, I hear; bring it to me!"

\g 
\l After they disappered into the distance, they told themselves: "We will buy that stick from this boy for half of the gold on the camels; it will be such a relieve for us! [why?]", they would say(?), "Why would we be anymore sad, if, when we are thirsty, we hit it and water appears for drinking; and when we are hungry, we get food that way."

\t Yiła nesiqorno eƛin, dey xediw yoł, žan ičin di q’ˤuyzix yik’a behizi yaqinč’iƛin.
\g 
\l She said to him: "I have a husband, and I won't be allowed to go to someone else."

\t Aždaħä bišanix baybik bodin.
\g 
\l The dragon began to eat.

\t Howži yeda bˤeƛ’de sadaq ʕaƛoxor ayn.
\g 
\l Now he came to the village together with the sheep.

\t Nesä ik’in xanez kidbes räxuruni ozuras meča ɣʷays ozuri ernosi, nełar nełaz ozuriƛ’aygon rig rukada roqno.
\g 
\l He went and after putting a dog's eye in place of the princess' dead eye, she began to see well again from her eye.

\t Eniwqno nesi užä esix zownanu babiya ža micxir c’idaɣor kurxoƛin.
\g 
\l The son didn't tell his mother that the father was throwing the money into the fire.

\t Elay bitor, ɣˤaɣˤun bizin, łˤonon iduɣor bik’inosi, yeženi esiw yesun, idu yiłe, q’ˤidan yičin yičäsi.
\g 
\l The three of them were very delighted, so when they went home, they found the older sister, sitting at home waiting.

\t Ražbadin igtow pašman oqno, yedu šebi däq roqäƛin.
\g 
\l Razhbadin became very sad: "What happened to me?"

\t Xizyo iguni halmaɣƛ’o mekʷan c’oxno, žukaniq bišʷan esirno, sosigon bišno žedu.
\g 
\l Afterwards, the good friend got hungry and asked the bad one for food, and they ate first.

\t Ža maxsarno bacin, łox äƛiru hunix Zeyes Aħya bˤałayn risno oč’ino q’ˤim yołali aždaħno bexurno xalq’imoƛ’ay yedu ɣudi roɣanƛintow ik’in.
\g 
\l Being bothered by this mockery, Bear Ear took his dagger and went to kill the dragon with the nine heads and to take this burden off the people.

\t Mamalayä nełar t’ok’ow bik’ač’inƛin rexuxanusi rožin teƛno, nece bayn čerayzaƛ’ onoča ža idur begirno.
\g 
\l The rooster gave his word, that he would not go to her anymore, and since he begged so much, the hen let him home.

\t Sidaquł yiłar mesedyos nak’ila yołäsi kid yodin.
\g 
\l One day she gave birth to a girl that had a golden pinky.

\t Encegon ƛ’iray reku roɣnosi, čanyas šilabi maħor roƛixno.
\g 
\l They took away a little more manure from above and a goat's horns appeared.

\t Hemeł mixƛ’o bˤeƛ’es reqenno adäz boc’no aħo oƛixno.
\g 
\l At that time, a shepherd appeared who drove a flock of sheep ahead.

\g 
\l On the third day, the fox came to the tree again and shouted to the bird: "Throw me down your nestling, or else I will throw the tree over and eat you together with it!"

\t Boƛƛ’o zaman bik’izaƛ’ortow, meɣu xizor yutin yayn.
\g 
\l Before much time had passed, the udder came back.

\g 
\l When he heard them talking, the hunter said to his wife, "Let the son on a hunt, if he won't go hunting, we won't have anything for our khinkali anyway."

\t Xizyogon oƛƛosini uži łic’oxno, debi baru yoł, yedu di yowa yayƛin.
\g 
\l Then the middle son intevened: "You have a wife, I have to marry her!"

\t Xizaɣor yiła harizi rodin nesiq, mi howža žek’u exurnäy, deber di barułun yičanƛin.
\g 
\l Finally she asked him: "When you kill that man, I will be your wife."

\t Žan eƛin ozƛäy bok’ełno.
\g 
\l Having said this, it flew out of sight.

\t Nełaƛ’no cey zek’ beginanu.
\g 
\l And even then the eagle didn't get startled.

\t ʕArabuzan yayn Ismaʕileł adäza yičin.
\g 
\l Arabuzan came before Ismail.

\t Dahawgon q’ʷarid oqno uži, yedu šebi däq roqä, šida di ceyq ʕenekizi oqinč’uƛin.
\g 
\l The boy became a little sad, [saying:] "What happened to me; why didn't I listen to the eagle?"

\t Łäs q’ut’un bic’no xizor butin nexzey, ħonbi dandir rik’in c’oxsiƛax, ceyes k’onč’aqaygon ret’un reƛno rik’isƛax.
\g 
\l He filled the jug with water and when when they returned, the mountains went together and closed and some flesh came off the eagle's leg.

\t Idur aynosi, yisä Paxrudinqor eƛin, bˤeƛ’ hohomłix ocä xeca rayƛin.
\g 
\l When he came home, he said to Pakhrudin: "The sheep must be left on the threshing floor in the cool air."

\t Łˤono äƛiru ɣudƛ’ogon č’urqˤotown q’ˤanon bežet’ani esnabi hunix boqno, yaqˤułgon yiqixana eluq yok’ek’anix sistow sis ƛäxuruni xanes kidƛin.
\g 
\l The third day then, in the morning, the two older brothers went on their way: "Today we might succeed in stealing the single remaining daughter from the king."

\t Rigutow riguƛin rok’ƛ’orno rayn, maħorno yoqno yiła guluzaƛ’ay q’ayn boɣno pikru bodin, Ražbadinqo iłäsi iłewa yeda där iyäƛin.
\g 
\l "Very good", she thought, came outside and took the articles off the horse and thought: "He looks like Razhbadin."

\t Ɣunoxor baynosi, osaxorno bizin cey ƛ’iräy ƛ’iyor tupäsi hil biłen nexno ɣunoł c’oxno.
\g 
\l When they came to the tree, the eagle got up into the height, came downwards from above like a gun's bullet and pounced on the tree.

\t K’uruč’ k’eč’ ɣudi rocu, buq bay.
\g 
\l All's well that ends well.

\t Hemełƛ’o ceyä eƛin, hi debi deber k’onč’aƛ’osi reƛno, yedun yałza caƛo, ƛ’irigon debez min zam-zames łi riħo, däzno hemedurtow riħoƛin.
\g 
\l Then the eagle said: "Take the meat of your own leg and stick it where it used to be! And smear holy water on yours and smear it also on mine."

\t Bełiquza nełaq, nazay ža t’or yayäƛin esirnosi, hemedur eniwn yexun, best’alłiƛ’no ƛexun bet’erbaqi bodanix maħor yoqäsiƛin esin.
\g 
\l When the hunters asked her, from where she came, she said that her mother died and she lived in orphanhood and went outside to make a living.

\t Elaygon izin ik’in yeda hemełatow iħuz lilyox qoqbi yałza mečoƛ’or ayn.
\g 
\l He got up from there, went along that river bank and came to a place where a cliff was.

\t ƛˤorłäy xizor utin aynosi, nesir barun užin besunanu.
\g 
\l When [the husband] came back from the war, he didn't find his wife and son.

\t Xizaɣor, ƛ’iri baru yutizaƛ’, xediw mešori bexada razi oqno.
\g 
\l Finally, because the wife convinced him, the husband agreed to slaughter the heifer.

\t Aqƛin, eƛin roƛik’no žaƛer q’ˤurin teƛno, q’ˤida ičirno.
\g 
\l "You may." she said, produced a chair, put it under the boy and sat him down.

\t Hudun, xizaɣor aħozä biyrno čanya bik’ixosi moči.
\g 
\l Nevertheless the shepherd finally found out the place where the goat went to.

\t Yaqˤułno yołƛax Bac’ali aderzoxortow čanyabi kikix, sasaq roxirno, neširaɣor žedar žedu rayn.
\g 
\l Today, it's said, Batsali is living just as before feeding the goats, chased the in the morning and they came back towards the evening by themselves.

\t Žedudäɣor ik’ałxor ħal anu deyƛin, xanä mušin kurno eƛin.
\g 
\l "I do not have the strength to go to them," the king sighed and said.

\t Di debi kid, mi dey eniw yiča yoł howžäy soderƛin.
\g 
\l From now on, I am your daughter and you are my mother.

\t Č’irin č’iki ɣudi rocu, buq bay.
\g 
\l All's well that ends well.

\t Ža kid idutow yesun.
\g 
\l The girl was at home.

\t Yizi nexxo bukayrun, žas babiw žedus hunärƛin nexƛ’oräy, užä xexłiƛ’ ħumukuliƛ’ay q’ayn boɣno bazargan xizor utirno.
\g 
\l When the boy's father came on their way as he saw them coming, the boy quickly took the goods off the camel and the merchant went back.

\t Bełiqanä nełas äƛirun rodin ža axar begirno.
\g 
\l The hunter did what it said and let her into his belly.

\t Nełƛ’ay neširu, sasiłnosi, rečuƛertow nexnäy rigu ana deberƛin.
\g 
\l Above that, wouldn't it be better for you if you come into the cattleshed after it got evening?"

\t C’ik’iw qizanyos q’ʷariłi C’irduxƛ’or bˤoƛ’un.
\g 
\l All the family's sadness fell unto Tsirdukh.

\t Hoboy eli sidqo sisno biłis, däƛ’ ƛ’iräy urɣelno bok’ełsiƛin.
\g 
\l Now we became similar to one another and the sorrow went away from me."

\t Hemedur anƛ’ima baħnayn žeduq sosikin bełi biqinanu.
\g 
\l So they walked around for a week and at first didn't get any prey.

\t Žigoƛ’ay ɣun q’ˤunader č’ˤaƛiłno roƛƛi regin.
\g 
\l This time the tree broke apart into two halves.

\t Gugyoq ričin łi ħaƛa koƛ’ixanuzogon žek’a eƛin, di ʕumruł sid žek’ur ħaƛa łi teƛinč’uƛin.
\g 
\l The man who couldn't drink the water on his back said: "I didn't give water to anyone for drinking, in my life."

\t Bayn yizi aziroyn xalq’imołäy berobi raqru ħonƛ’or.
\g 
\l They came to the mountain, which arose from the ice of the frozen people.

\t Nesi žoyä nełar boƛik’no čantay aluk’ani heneš teƛno.
\g 
\l The boy gave her the white apple that he took out of his pocket.

\t Elay oqno nexno yeda idur ayn.
\g 
\l He went away from there and came to his home.

\t Nełaƛ’no razi oqinč’ey, xanä Qartay nesider yayrno gurow kidbabi regärinč’iƛin sisgon žeduł adäza misal erno.
\g 
\l Then once again the king didn't agree, he put another problem before him: "I won't send girls to you, except for if you bring Qartay."

\t Bišadyoƛ’orƛin yizä reƛ’a regirƛ’oräy, Beqes ʕUneyzatä xizor roɣrerno yiziq, dahaw zamanał bičiƛin.
\g 
\l When they reached for the food with their hands, Sun's Uneyzat ordered them to take them back: "Wait a little!"

\t ƛ’iräy ħulin kurno, bercinawt’a kidbazaƛ’orno rutin, ɣˤayz orezna teł žedu esanadanix roqno.
\g 
\l Having thrown off their feathers, they turned into beautiful girls and began to bathe in the pond of milk.

\t Yeɣeni esiwde sadaq žan yuqˤno, gulun rečuƛ bicin, bežet’ani esnabi bayaniqor idu ezun ičäsi zown.
\g 
\l He hid her together with her younger sister, tied the horse to the shed, and waited at home for his older brothers to come.

\t Zownƛax zown anuƛax ʕoƛno esiwn, žeduł tełgon sis esiyn.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there were seven brothers, and among them was one sister.

\t Ža kidno esnazade xecin, yaraɣno ħiroq caƛin, guluƛ’no zown Ismaʕil oqno ik’in sida ʕaƛar ayn.
\g 
\l Ismail left that girl with her brothers, threw his weapon over his shoulder, mounted his horse, rode off and came to a village.

\t Wizirä xanqor eƛin, hemeła qalamä teł sis aɣi yoł, nełasgo bik boqnäy, debez bokor ʕeze baqƛin.
\g 
\l The vizier said to the king, "In that fortress there is a bird, if you can get its hide, it will be enough for your coat."

\t Elo nazosno daʕba boqno, howži yisi xanqor eƛin:
\g 
\l There everyone argued and then they said to the king:

\g 
\l Because she had asked three times without getting an answer, [saying] "Now they're sleeping", she took the red-hot stick and - thinking it were the boys - put it onto the necks of the girls and went to sleep.

\t Šebi royłin yeda uži ik’inč’ey ičinanu.
\g 
\l No matter what to do, the boy had to go.

\t Sida quł ečruni ɣˤanaza maħor yaqrus riłen rodin, xalno bodin yičin.
\g 
\l One day the old woman pretended to go outside, but waited and payed attention.

\t Ozzaq ža yiħinosi, Ismaʕiler č’ura rukayn, hudun yisis ozurabi rošun c’oxno, iyxanusi iłe oqno.
\g 
\l Ismail smeared it on his eyes and could see again, but nevertheless, his eyes became slanted and he was like someone unknown.

\t Xexłiƛ’ t’ay xizor ik’iƛin, qˤaƛanayn žedu q’ebedzo užiqor.
\g 
\l Get back away quickly!", they yelled at the smith's son.

\t Sasaqosi elo baɣmaz egin ik’ix zawru žek’uqor yisi doxturä eƛin, mi äƛiruce mesed neƛan deber di, där šeƛ’un rown mi nexnäyƛin.

\l In the morning the doctor said to the man passing through the garden, "If you will bring me clothing, I will give you as much gold as you say."

\t Onoču sosisi begirxanuƛin inkarno boyn bičäsi zown, yaqˤułno łoħrodär bik’iƛin.

\l "I won't let you in", the hen rejected at first, "Go to the frog again, today!"

\t Hič’č’a adäza bäqiruni guluƛ’no zown, xanes uži hawaƛ’ k’oƛin ik’in t’awus bičixozoni qoqxor.
\g 
\l He took the first horse and rode to the cliff where the peacock lives.

\t Hemeła quł Okur čuqˤno, yisi užä nesiqay ʕilmu yiqärułi.
\g 
\l That day, Oku noticed that the boy took away the science from him.

\t Best’al eniwn, bužin erno nełade sadaq egäruni žek’un guluzaz maħizaqorno bicin ʕaƛay maħor boxirno.
\g 
\l The step-mother and the man she sent together with her, who was put hope into, were tied to horses' tails and were chased out of the village.

\t Kidbä eƛin, žan nesis ruyxor yołƛin.
\g 
\l His daughter said: "That of him is true."

\t Sida quł, ɣudod, maħazayzo ɣuɣaymo yedu moƛaxay č’arik’no.

\l One day at midnight a noise from far outside woke her up from her sleep.

\t Yeženigon esiya, šebin resun yisirƛin, bak’ima tełäyn begirno aɣi q’ˤidar kurnosi, nełłäy qˤirič’ roqno.
\g 
\l The older sister said "He found something!", let the bird out of the coop and threw it on the ground, so he turned into a pair of scissors.

\t Elo sida ixiw aħinoƛno biqin łˤono q’ˤim yołäsi bikori č’ač’aƛix yisir bukayn.
\g 
\l There he saw a three-headed snake that got under a big rock and was squeaking there.

\t Užä nesä nesis murad esinosi, besura hoqoƛno iqirno, raładyoz iƛ’aqaɣor ižin ža.
\g 
\l After the boy had told his wish, the fish took him into its mouth and carried him to the bottom of the sea.

\t Baq’ˤu xalq’i bexurxo bukaynosi, ƛäxuru boxin bik’in.
\g 
\l Having seen the many killed people, the remaining ones ran away.

\t Sis aždaħes xexoy biqirno ent’or bownäy, neła ʕazara roqˤuma igor nexa žek’u egirxosi anuƛin.
\g 
\l If you take away one of the dragon's youngs and bring it here, it will not let any man come closer than a thousand steps.

\t Babiya žaqor eƛin, elin bežet’a bizin ži, deberno maʕišat betix boqzaƛ’, q’ebedłiƛ’or ruhun oqƛin.
\g 
\l The father said to his son: "We are getting old now, when you begin to want [to make] a fortune, learn to work as a smith!"

\t K’emotya kidno yuqˤek’no yičin zown nełas eniw.
\g 
\l The girl's mother locked her away in a chest.

\t Budumä äsiru xabaryoƛ’ xan c’aq’ ʕažaibno oqno, nesir micxirno teƛno, ƛ’irigon bigu saɣyatno bodin, žan egirno.
\g 
\l The king was very surprised about what the muezzin told, he gave him money and nice presents and let him go.

\t Xanes sis ħalikataw madaxosi žek’u zown.
\g 
\l The king had a mean guard.

\t Neła qułno idur q’ʷaridaw yeda ayzaƛ’, bara esirno, yaqˤułgon łinax q’ʷarid oqnoƛin.
\g 
\l That day, because he came home said, his wife asked: "Why did you come home sad today as well?"

\t Howžin hemedurtow yołƛax žedu.

\l And it's said they still are like that.

\l The people were very glad that he had taken the misfortune from them, and after that, they didn't want to let Bear Ear go anywhere, gave him respect and esteem and insisted in keeping him.

\t Ža łi micxiryoƛ’or rutin.
\g 
\l And this water turned into money/jewelry.

\l Tavadi said that and went outside.

\g 
\l In that moment, Arabuzan went to him quickly as the wind and brought the king's daughter and threw it onto Ismail's horse.

\t Xizyogon howžatow geresni hibo aždaħä ɣoɣorik’ƛ’orey, C’iɣruk’ä ħamori kurno.

\l Again, when the dragon heated that iron staff, Tsighruk coughed.

\t Ža kaɣat yaynosi babiya uži egirno, ciqqorno yižin esiwn yexurno nełas rok’u däq rukaranix ħamayn roɣno raƛin.

\l After reading the letter, the father sent his son: "Lead your sister into the forest and kill her, take away her heart out of her chest and bring it here to show it to me."

\t Sida quł eƛnoq yaq’ˤu, žek’u maħor oqełxanuzo ħalał, isi yayn.
\g 
\l One day in winter it snowed so hard, that people couldn't even go outside.

\t Esa koƛ’inč’izaƛ’, heresi mec esa baynč’i.

\l "When you don't know what to say, you shouldn't tell a lie.

\g 
\l He gave the child to drink, and he went to give her water for the fourth time.

\t Xan, di nexäsi yoł čara, res anusi debi kid däz Goqix esiranixƛin”.
\g 
\l "King, I have come to you in order to ask for your daughter to be married to my Goqi."

\t Oh, mi nedurä q’urumsaq zownƛin, bizirno bok’nosi, yisägon yedu bečnabi cuciłace raƛ’moƛxor šiširno.

\l One day they happened to go somewhere together.

\t Iduɣor ayƛ’oräy, ačqˤaq quqix kikoƛ’osi xexbin risno sida q’orolayä yoƛixno esirno:
\g 
\l When coming home, he saw the widow with her child (at her breast), which almost died of thirst, and asked:

\t Xaner bič’zi roqno elo q’ˤano c’ohor zawrułin, sisinigon elay oxin äk’irułin.
\g 
\l The king understood that there were two thiefs and the other one had run away from there.

\t Elus esiw na yołƛin neła esirnosi, q’ˤuya šaharyaɣor ik’äsiƛin, yaƛ’irno nesä ža.
\g 
\l When she asked: "Where is our brother?", he lied to her: "He has gone to another city."

\t Nełƛ’ay soder łinasnokin ħinq’i anusi ciqaɣor ʕomoybin rik’ix zown.
\g 
\l After that, the donkeys went into the forest without any danger.

\t Eniw tamaša yoqno ƛexun, nay ža deber nece his riqäƛin.
\g 
\l His mother was astonished: "Where did you get so much wool from?"

\t Izäsi C’irdux, q’ˤuyasinibi kecäsiƛin, C’irduxä žawab bodin.
\g 
\l "Tsirdukh is awake, the others are sleeping." answered Tsirdukh.

\g 
\l They went that way and said to the toastmaster: "[???]"; one of them went outside to took whether they had killed the wolf as they said.

\t Cek’i guzqay guzqor k’oƛix boč’ik’xo bičäsi zewn.
\g 
\l The goat kid ran from rock to rock and felt cold.

\t Hemełaƛ’ ʕoloqan žek’a eƛin, howži dey ruħ boɣno xot’ozaxor baysƛin.
\g 
\l Then the young man said: "Now my soul has been taken away and it has come up to my feet."

\t Hič’č’a bercinawni kid šeƛ’un resunč’ey, howlotow ƛexun.
\g 
\l The most beautiful girl didn't find her clothes and thus stayed there.

\t Ixinabin ric’no yizä ža ukrun, micxirno iduɣor bižin.
\g 
\l Having filled their bags, they brought the silver and money home.

\g 
\l He heard the oldest one say: "What talent do I have? I'll want to marry the boy who took the boat full of clothes away from me after he pulled out my hair, while I was pulling on the boat."

\t Yeda ʕuraw ɣˤaɣˤun izin, hoboy ik’an di xanes kid esiranixƛin, oqno maħor.
\g 
\l He got very happy, said: "Now I will go to the princess and ask her [to marry me].", and he went outside.

\t Sidaquł yizä ža k’et’u bižin ciqor begirno.
\g 
\l One day they took the cat out and sent him into the forest.

\t Sida maqˤizoni ʕaƛa bečedaw žek’us ɣudƛ’ay ɣudƛ’or ħalaq’ oqxo uži ik’ix zown.
\g 
\l In a village far away, a rich man's son was getting thinner day by day.

\t Hemedur sadaq ʕumru bodix zown eɣeni užän, łoħrołäy yaqruni bercinawni kidbän.
\g 
\l So the young boy and the beautiful girl that became of the frog were living together.

\t Žan eƛin Ħusen hunix oqno.
\g 
\l Hussein said that and went on his way.

\t K’uruč’ k’eč’ ɣudi rocu, buq bay!
\g 
\l Kurch, pearl, may the weather be good and the sun come out.

\t Hemedurtow xanes yoƛƛosini kidno qalamäy yoɣno, xizor utin iduɣor nexno.
\g 
\l In the same way he took the king's middle daughter from the fortress and came back home.

\t Di dowzo Goqix kid egiran, amma där ža ukada ayƛin”.
\g 
\l "I will send my daughter to your Goqi, but I have to see him."

\t Eludegon ƛirbałix keze oqno idu teł kecnäy lamus bičixosiƛin, oqno ičin.
\g 
\l And he was like: "And for us it's a shame if someone is a guest and sleeps in one's home."

\t Rac’inč’uƛin, boc’ä ot’ bisno.
\g 
\l "Didn't eat them," the wolf rejected.

\t Sosi bic’no ik’inosi, aždaħä yisiqor roži eƛinanu.
\g 
\l When he first filled the jug, the dragon didn't say a word to him.

\t Bertenyołer goƛ’in zawruni žedu aħozä eƛin, eluz bˤeƛ’xo imadabi esanix beže maxšel yołäsi sis žek’u yoł.
\g 
\l A shepherd who was invited to the wedding, said: "There is a man with our sheep who has a big talent of telling tales.

\t Yizi nasin sidaɣ aɣˤuxor rayn.
\g 
\l They all came to a mill.

\t Ceyn neła nełaz raƛ’maɣor boržizin boqno bik’in, yedan iduɣor nexno.
\g 
\l When the eagle flew into his own country, also he returned home.

\t Di ža ħoyä tełerno kurno ik’ursiƛin, eƛin Ħusenä.
\g 
\l I threw him into the oven and let him burn.", said Hussein.

\t Howda boqłin bižan zirurƛin boržizi boqno ɣʷˤadi iduɣor nexƛ’oräy, nełał adäzar osiw ħon keze yoqno.
\g 
\l "Although it's just that, I'll carry it to the fox.", [said the crow and] while it was flying back home, a high mountain came towards it.

\t Igaɣor bayƛ’oräy, hič’č’an yeɣeni esiyagon, babiya nełqor teƛno zawruni, hiƛu kurno.
\g 
\l When it came closer, the youngest sister threw down the comb that their father had given to her.

\t Howži, nesä bexaru xabaryoƛ’ Ħasanä imanno erno, razin oqno, yisi Ox̌oyode zendi ečula ʕUmarno egirno.
\g 
\l Now, Hassan believed in the what he got told, he agreed and sent his grandchild Umar together with Ohoyo.

\t Ɣʷˤadi ɣunoƛ’ neła nełaz mežä kecno bičäsi zown.
\g 
\l The crow was sleeping in its own nest on a tree.

\t Nełaz meča sis ɣˤʷayn bexurno, nełas rok’un roɣno, babiwder ik’in, ele däz esiws rok’uƛin.
\g 
\l Instead of her, he killed a dog and took out its heart and went to his father: "Here, my sister's heart."

\t Sidaɣ osiw qoqƛ’or raynosi, zira, ent’az rigu huni yołƛin, zey qoqƛ’ay wˤałer begirno.
\g 
\l They came to a high cliff in one place, so the fox said "Here is a good way!", and let the bear go down from the cliff.

\t Xanä nesiqor xabar boynosi, uži razi oqno.
\g 
\l When the king told him the story, the boy agreed.

\t Yisä yisiz madax łäs bic’äsi q’ut’u biħurnosi, zam-zames łäs kik boƛixno.
\g 
\l After he poured out the water-filled jug in his yard, a spring of holy water appeared.

\t Esnaza nesiq žeda žedus murad esinosi, xanä žeduq sis imadu esin:
\g 
\l After the brothers told him their wish, the king told them a fairy tale.

\t Ħoyäy magalu boɣoƛin Ħusenqor eƛinosi, mi bukarƛin ičin Ħusen.
\g 
\l When he said to Hussein: "Take the bread out of the oven!", Hussein waited [saying]: "You show me!"

\t Elo dey recenyocet’a isʷa zows.
\g 
\l There I had bulls, each one like an ant.

\t Hoq’ˤonägon eƛin, di yisiqay kapekkin yisäsi anuƛin.
\g 
\l The other one said: "I didn't even take one kopeck from him."

\t Ele žeduz ʕaq’lu anunč’uru xabaryoƛ’ dey qoqoƛu regis.
\g 
\l There, I'm laughing about their mindless gossip.

\t Hunix egirƛ’oräy, bełiqa žaqor eƛin, hunix šebigon dandir c’oxłin, mi nełar kumak bodoƛin.
\g 
\l While sending him on his way, the hunter told his son, "No matter whom you may meet on your way, help them!"

\t Elay ža yoqno etixozoder yik’in.
\g 
\l From there she went to her lover and they came together.

\t Neła ɣunoƛ’ ƛ’iri ceyes xexoyabi teł yołäsi muži zown.
\g 
\l On that tree there was a nest with young eagles inside.

\t Žoyän nesiq neširu raqru łinałäy esin.
\g 
\l The boy also told him what had happened at night.

\t Ža yoxärus, äƛiruxor, xanä bertenno bodin, deber rätiru šebinon riso iduɣor yik’iƛin riyrno.
\g 
\l The king, as he had said, organized a wedding on the [day of the] divorce and explained: "Take everything you want and go home!"

\t Užä nesä nesis oˤɣqay reč’no reƛ łeɣirsiƛax ceyez k’onč’aq.
\g 
\l The boy cut flesh from his own thigh and glued it to the eagle's leg.

\t Sida quł ziru čanaqanłiƛ’ bik’in.
\g 
\l One day the fox went hunting.

\t Ħusen igtow ƛ’irin utin ža xizor utiranix eƛin, dowƛ’osi q’ʷariłi bisanir di ik’ix mi xizorno uti, di aceł caƛäsi c’eruc’a yoł, nagaħ där sis šebin roqnäy, nełas iyo boƛäx, c’ik’iw šebin ruyxor rik’inäy ɣˤay yešnayƛin.
\g 
\l Hussein insisted and said to make him turn back: "I am coming to take away the sadness on you, go back! I have shot with the bow at the door; suppose something will happen to me, it's [the arrow's] blood will appear, and if everything will go alright, then milk will drip out."

\t Zownƛax, zownanuƛax sis xan, nesis zown sistow sis kid.
\g 
\l Once upon a time there was a king who had just one daughter.

\t Bečedawni žek’a nesi žaq q’ˤanontow ganbi regirno.
\g 
\l And the rich man sent the two bulls to this boy.

\t Hemełƛ’ay soder q’orolaz užis raħataw, paraxataw ʕumru zown, ħalikatawt’ani halmaɣzaqay bat’an oqno.
\g 
\l After that, the widow's son lead a serene, quiet life, bereft of mean friends.

\t Žaz bara eƛin, bercingo eƛi- mołinäy posukin ʕenekizi roqxonč’eƛin.
\g 
\l His wife said: "If you teach well, even animals will listen."

\t Nesä nesiz nukarzaƛ’ xaličabin rułirno.
\g 
\l And the mats he shared among his own henchmen.

\t Nesirno howžatow sayɣatno boyn, hemedurtow nesiqorno eƛin.
\g 
\l To him he gave the same present and said the same thing.

\t Mi nełqor eƛo:

\l "Tell her:

\g 
\l They gathered all necessary articles together, and when they prepared to go outside, Sun's Uneyzat said: "We will ride on my horse."

\t Zamanałäzay boržizin boqno q’ˤano t’umi bayn.
\g 
\l After some time two pigeons came flying.

\t Yeda di ciqez xaner bižix, min nełar sis is baƛin”.
\g 
\l "I'm bringing this to the king of the forest, bring him a bull!"

\t Mi däƛ’ ƛ’iräy oqƛin.
\g 
\l Forgive me."

\t Hemedur ƛ’irizoni dunyalƛ’or yedan ayrno, xizor butin ceyn bik’in.
\g 
\l So the eagle brought him into the world above and turned back.

\t Izin akiqno t’it’aħin, tełxor q’orolas reƛ’a roƛik’no, elo žan c’unizi yodin bäčiruni nukarza, rok’no mač’an reč’no roɣno.
\g 
\l He got up and clutched at the window, and let the widow's hand appear inside, and the henchmen who were guarding her cut it off with their saber(s).

\t Neł kawumoz acmoq rexoriłno zawru ɣˤʷak’un riqirno yizanƛin yaqru ža, ƛ’irir ža yoq’ˤugani acno yoƛ’ˤun Qartayn ƛ’iƛ’iłno yexun.
\g 
\l Qartay took the hook that hang at the door of that gate, began to get up; the heavy door fell down, Qartay got crushed and died.

\t Sis zown babiwn nesisgon łˤono užin.
\g 
\l Once there was a father and his three sons.

\t Zamanałäygon neside puħo, puräzagon t’asno eqerno, ža ɣˤanabin q’ˤida yičin.
\g 
\l And after some time the woman sat down next to him and put a washbowl at his side.

\t Łox äƛirugon mač’an risno ik’in ža kikxaɣor q’ut’u bic’a.
\g 
\l The third time he took a dagger and went to the spring to fill the jug with water.

\t Eženi žek’ur barkalan zahir bodin, Ħusen nesä nesiz hunix oqno.
\g 
\l Hussein thanked the old man and went on his way.

\t Łˤora beciz bolžalyos hunice maqˤi deber yetixosi kid yoqłin, neł č’ikayär ezunäy, debeł ža adäz yičirxosi”.
\g 
\l "Even if the girl that you love is as far away as a 3 months' journey, when you look into that mirror, she will be put in front of you."

\t Elaygon beƛ’q’ˤun bižin aħołun ik’is.
\g 
\l From there I went as a shepherd to carry sheep.

\t Žeda nesiqor eƛin, šeƛ’u xizor neƛƛin.
\g 
\l They said to him: "Give the clothes back!"

\t Łäƛ’or yäk’iru yiła kidber neł aždaħä, ƛirbar retäsi roqzaƛ’ƛin, bic’no sis tungi teƛno.
\g 
\l The dragon gave the girl that went to look for water a jug filled with water, because that happened to be what the guest wanted.

\t Yizi didiwtow xalq’i, ziys ħošos reɣet’a t’it’urbi bazarya teƛanix nexxosi, yizä elułäy ʕabdalbitowwa boyxƛin, nasin xalq’in ƛ’iri butin, ʕoƛnon esnabi nocubi caƛix bazaryay boxirno.
\g 
\l "What kind of people are they, coming to sell small pieces of cow hide on the market; are they making fools of us?!", all the people insisted and spitting on the seven brothers chased them off the market.

\t Ža aq’ˤiłxotow ik’ix zown, sida ɣudƛ’or buci bayruce, sis buci baynosi ƛˤeb yayru iłe.
\g 
\l While he was growing up, one day became like a month and one month was like a year.

\g 
\l You must lend him clothes and a horse."

\t Xizyo nesi eženä reč’no ža ɣun.
\g 
\l Afterwards the old man chopped down that tree.

\t Tełäy aqrun, nesä šeƛ’un xiszi rodin, sis ganin biqirno, ozyoł xizay oqno.
\g 
\l Having gotten out, he changed clothes, took a bull.calf and got behind the army.

\t Neširutow moƛaxayn bizirno, sosigon bišerno yiła yizi kecerno.
\g 
\l At night he woke them up from their sleep, fed them again and put them to bed.

\t Idu łi anuƛin, esiya eƛin.
\g 
\l "There is no water at home", said the sister.

\t ʕAƛoz ʕoloqza Ražbadinƛ’o ʕayib erxo zown bexuranix xexbi begirnoƛin, nesä yołi halmaɣłi łet’in.
\g 
\l The young people of the village were blaming Razhbadin for sending his children for them to get killed, whereas he, however, choose friendship.

\t Ismaʕilä eƛin, di meka isäsi yoł, ence där rac’a šebin neƛƛin.
\g 
\l Ismail said: "I am hungry, give me a little to eat!"

\l She said to her mother: 'When somewhere some young people were killing me, the boy who is standing over there outside came about, gave them three rubles and saved [me].'

\t Yisä žedus šebin elo- t’o esaniqno bˤuƛ’no, c’ohorza mesedyos yic’äsi k’emot’ yisiden xecin, boxin bik’in.
\g 
\l Being afraid that he will tell about their doings here and there, the thieves left the box filled with gold and ran away.

\t Bercingo xal boynosi, besuroz qeqa teł t’akan c’oxäsi yesun.
\g 
\l When he examined it better, he found a broken glass.

\t Tełäzay sis žuka ɣˤanabin yoƛixno esirno nesiq, heresi esa kaƛ’iya, kaƛ’inč’a.
\g 
\l From inside a bad woman appeared and asked him: "Can you tell a lie or not?

\l Nevertheless, the father said to the children in their dream: 'When you come walking to my grave before 40 days have passed, I will get said silver for you.'

\t Yexursiƛingon žawab nesän teƛno.
\g 
\l "I killed her.", he answered.

\t Mesedyoztow ƛäƛ’ kidbedäɣorgon ik’inosi, elo mesedyos ric’äsi istowli resun.

\l When he went over the golden bridge to his daughter, he found a table filled with gold there.

\g 
\l The next morning after getting up from sleeping, he built a big house as said, and when the king saw the golden bridge erected from his door to his daughter's door, he remained looking at it with an open mouth.

\t Meži łˤonontow esira däder nexłin, mežurno riyx ža, hudun di mežułäy sider gurow yäqinč’i.

\l "You three have come to me in order to ask me out, you know that, and so I won't get to any of you except for one.

\l The girl recovered soon.

\g 
\l The king who had sent the horse assigned Awdunasir a task: He would give the kingdom to the man who came to him riding that horse, but if it does not bring a man, then he would send his daughter to another king's son, take away his land and throw him off the throne.

\t Sasaqozox žarno yiynč’ey maħorno yoqno, q’orola žaz babiwq esin nesiƛ’ yałru q’ʷariłiłäy.

\l It is said they're still alive now and are living together with the father a calm life without a need for anything.

\t Xizyo xaner riyn, c’ohoresno, nesiz nukarzasno qunyox raqru łinałäyn.

\l Then the king found out what had happened to the thief and to his henchmen on the farmstead.

\t Ɣowlotown eɣeni esiwn muk’ur oqno.

\l And then the younger brother confessed.

\t Hudaygon yeda łäƛ’or tungin bižin ik’in, nełaƛ’no aždaħä yisiqor roži eƛin anu.

\l In the morning the mother looked in the cattle shed and did not find gold.

\l When he came to the palace, he remained looking at it in astonishment.

\t Žeduqor big bičiƛinno eƛin, bełiqan hunix oqno nesä nesiz ʕaƛaɣor ik’anix.
\g 
\l The hunter said to them: "Farewell!" and got on his way to go to his own village.

\t Bežet’ani esnaza yeda hemedurtow egirno anu.
\g 
\l The elder brothers didn't let him do so.

\t T’omceni žek’u aynäy, nesä mi exarƛin.
\g 
\l When the span-sized man comes, he will kill you!"

\t Nełagon roɣno neła nełaz bašił erno.
\g 
\l She [Umukus] took it out and put it on her finger.

\t Yizir ža xan łinax iyx yizis babiw yałrułi.
\g 
\l How should they know that this king is their father?

\t Nesä žazar wasiyat bodin:
\g 
\l He left his sons his last will:

\t Maħama žigon aƛ’in Aħmadqor, mi ʕabdal esunč’inäy eƛ’isi riƛu žiƛbo räƛiyäƛin.
\g 
\l Again now Magomed scolded Akhmed: "If you weren't a fool, would you plough last year's field this year?"

\t Bilq’isdis xedyos eɣeni esiw ičix zown netey xalq’imor žukłi roda riqanƛin, žedu sidä sidƛ’or codix.
\g 
\l Bilqisdi's husband had a younger brother, whenever possible he harmed people; and he incited them against one another.

\t Nełagon eniwqay izmun bisno, ža t’umi bexurač’inƛin nełqay rožin riqirno, akin raɣˤin tełxor begärun, bik’in kidbez q’ˤimƛ’o heqno.
\g 
\l It [the pigeon] asked permission from the mother and took her word that she would never kill this pigeon; she opened the window and let it inside, and it flew in and sat down on the girl's head.

\t Žedu bičix zown ciqo sidaɣ qunyox.
\g 
\l They were living on a farmstead somewhere in the forest.

\t Nełƛ’ay soder, dicegon Alimaħama qoqoƛiłin, šida mi qoqoƛixƛin, bara esirno anu.
\g 
\l After that, no matter how often Alimagomed laughed, his wife didn't ask "Why are you laughing?" ever again.

\t Debin barusno c’ok’ini raqƛin, eƛin bazarganza.
\g 
\l "You will have a quarrel with your wife." said the merchants.

\t Babiw ƛ’irir ayrun, žoyä esin nesiq eniya äƛiruxor, wallahi eniwn alžanä yoł.

\l When the father came, the boy told him what the mother had said: "By God, mother is in heaven!

\t Neł mixƛ’o dibirä eƛin, žeda debeq c’aq’tow bit’araw esin.
\g 
\l Thereupon the imam said: "They told you the very truth!"

\g 
\l One day the man started to utilize the bulls to pull logs and to plough the field, but they didn't comply at all, and when he put the yoke on them, they didn't feel like it at all.

\t Xizyo ža ela cimyoqaysi becurno boɣsiƛin.
\g 
\l Afterwards we broke it out of rage and threw it away."

\t Nesä eƛin, tełäzay roč k’ek’-rik’ernosi, di meža izirƛin.

\l He said: "When I move the rope from down there, lift me up!"

\t Maħlar bayruntow, xanä eƛin, eloš neła imyoqor yicalini ɣˤanazar naʕanan bodo, nocun caƛo nełasƛin.
\g 
\l When they came into the court, the king said: "Curse and spit on that woman over there, who is tied to that pole!"

\t Ža hunin risno ik’iƛ’orey, sida maydanƛ’or keze oqno.
\g 
\l When he took the way, he came to a clearance.

\t Łinasnokin pikru boynč’ey, esnabi ɣˤulabi caƛix qidobi kuša boqno.
\g 
\l Without thinking, the brothers began demolishing the wall by throwing stones.

\g 
\l There the younger brother thought of playing a trickery on them: he would lead a mule packed with vodka and would "water" the king's henchmen and then would steal his older brother's corpse from there.

\t Ele di t’o yoł, däder biħadanix boq maħorƛin”, - eƛin nesä žawab boyn.
\g 
\l "Here I am, come out to me and fight!", he answered.

\t Däz halmaɣer sisgon uži odinƛin” - eƛin zira.
\g 
\l "My friend has born another son", said the fox.

\t Nesiqorno hemedurtow, mesedyos saħ neƛnäy nexanƛin, eƛin.

\l And she said to him as well: "If you give me your Sah of gold, I will come."

\t ʕAƛos nasin žamaʕatno butirno, reƛis ric’xot’a ħurubi eqerno žeduł adäza.

\l They gathered the village's entire population and put basins filled with meat before them.

\t Užizar ža xabarno teqno, žedu daʕbałer begin, di ik’ixƛin Ħasan, ay di ik’ixƛin Ħusen.
\g 
\l When the boys heard that, they started a dispute: "I am going!", said Hassan; "No, I am going!" said Hussein.

\t Ħalarno izin xedya eƛin, c’udani mamalays ħuli ozqo biħinäy, ozłer kanłi bayxƛin där teqäsi zows.

\l The husband got up to help and said: "If one smears the red rooster's feather on the eye, the eyesight comes back... I've heard."

\l After he came to, Ismail got up and went to Arabuzan and said to the king: "Come now, cut off her neck!"

\g 
\l Respect the guest, wife, my power is ending."

\g 
\l Furthermore, a home is a necessary thing.

\t Bˤałno gulun yeda qalamäɣor, nesä nesiz baruzadäɣor ezunč’ey ik’in.
\g 
\l His horse rushed on to that fortress and he went to his wives straight without looking.

\t Žan bisno ik’in, łˤonon užibin tełäy boɣno, kʷaxatow ečruni žek’u xizor utin ayn.

\l The old man took it and went away, freed his three sons and quickly came back.

\t Zey, däz halmaɣer uži odin.
\g 
\l "Bear, a friend of mine has born a son.

\t Neła quł ħaƛ’ala yisiq łˤono besuro biqin.
\g 
\l On that day, he hardly caught three fish.

\t (Ža kid c’aq’ bercinaw, ƛ’iräy ozuri boɣa retixanusi yiłe zown.)

\l (That girl was so beautiful, that one wouldn't want to keep the eyes from her.)

\t ʕAƛar aynƛin teqzaƛ’ortow Ražbadin yizzoxor oƛixzaƛ’, kidbez babiya bigtow tamašan bodin, yisiz ħurmatyoxay rigu bišʷan rodin.
\g 
\l Because Razhbadin appeared at their place before he heard that he had come to the village, the girl's dad was very surprised and out of respect for him he prepared a good meal.

\t Elay yoqno yik’in Bilq’isdi sida ʕaƛar yayn.
\g 
\l From there Bilqisdi left and came to a village.

\t Dey ħumukuli bukaynč’uƛinno eƛix meža, nełas c’ik’iw sipatno esix.
\g 
\l "You say that you haven't seen my camel, and you tell me its entire appearance.

\l "If that is the case," Magomed said to his daughter, "take this cheese bread, go and say to him: ''Fog has come up, and the moon is still not full."

\t Howži hudu xanä nesiqor eƛin, nedur resunäy, hi, enda micxir beč’xosi kesun biso, iłira becider mi nełdär ezäɣor izinč’inäy, debi di meč’ beč’a yołƛin.

\l Then the king said to him: "If that's the case, here, take the coining form, and if you haven't gotten up the fortress to her within six months, I will cut off your neck."

\t Nagaħ uži miskinłiƛ’or aynäy, babiyä kobora teł eqerno xecäsi micxiryosno, mesedyosno ric’äsi ixin zown.

\l In case the boy would hit poverty, there was a bag filled with money and gold left inside the granary, put there by the father.

\t Mač’a meč’ beč’oƛ, tupi rok’eł c’oxoƛ, ašunä oƛƛo eč’oƛƛin.
\g 
\l May the dagger cut his neck, may the rifle hit is heart and may the belt cut him in the middle!

\g 
\l They say that Qarum still didn't recover from the beatings.

\g 
\l That day, they didn't encounter anything at all in the forest.

\t Best’al kidbes sis ziya zown.
\g 
\l The stepdaughter had a cow.

\t Reƛno łiyn k’onč’aqay reč’no kuräsi zows, howlaytow iyos zok’in ric’äsi zowsƛin”, - esin yisä.
\g 
\l "When the meat ended, I cut some from my leg and threw it to you, and from there I filled the blood into a mug", he told.

\t Xizyogon eženä, ac yaɣˤoƛin, eƛin.
\g 
\l Then the old one said: "Open the door!"

\t Buq bätuza puƛ’azay guluƛ’no zown yisir eže žek’u nexxo ukayn.
\g 
\l In the south he saw an old man riding on a horse coming towards him.

\t Xizyo yiła užiq esin, howži eliz guluz hisona teł mesed besuxanuƛin.
\g 
\l Then she told to her son, "Now there is no gold in the trough of our horse."

\t Žas baru, hawšinaw q’ʷariłin biqin, xizaɣor idur yutizaƛ’.
\g 
\l The son's wife, having endured so much sadness, has finally come back home.

\g 
\l Then Umar turned into a lamb, Ohoyo turned into a fox, Umar into a goat kid - he into an eagle, he into a sheep - Ohoyo into a wolf, Umar turned into a cow - he into a bear.

\t Ayn žan eženi esiw ayruni kikxortow.
\g 
\l Also he came to the spring the older brother came to.

\t ƛ’irigon C’iɣruk’ä acno yuqin naysinan ok’bi rok’no.
\g 
\l But then Tsighruk closed the door and put in nails everywhere.

\t K’ox äƛirugon uži uqˤełanix ik’in.
\g 
\l For the second time, the boy went into hiding.

\t Xizyogon c’urun-c’aranƛin” eƛixosi k’emot’ wˤałer yayn.

\l Then the crate came down that she said "Tsurun-tsaran!" to.

\t Neł mixƛ’o ceyä žaqor eƛin, di dowqor yeɣe k’emot’ neƛan, ža mi dowz ɣˤutkoxor ayzaƛ’or yaɣˤinƛin.

\t ʕAbdal di zows yołƛin, eƛin ʕomoyä, ciqqotow łemuri mi di bac’ƛin.
\g 
\l "If I were a fool," said a donkey, "you would've eaten me in the forest."

\t Elo q’ebedes užin xecin xizyo qartay ħadur yoqno yik’anix.
\g 
\l And the witch prepared to go away, leaving the smith's son there.

\t Nesiq reƛ’an ata regirinč’ey Tawadä eƛin, yeda eluł teł sisxoli yoł.
\g 
\l Tavadi didn't let them touch him and said: "He is alone among us."

\g 
\l Then the father began [trying] to catch him.

\t Yoƛƛo ƛˤeb yik’izaƛ’ortow žedur užin oynƛax.
\g 
\l After less than a year has gone by, a son was born to them.

\t Eluqƛa iziräłinč’i mi elo ƛ’irir, hudunon eloš neła ceyqo harizi rodan elaƛin”, - eƛin xanä.
\g 
\l "We cannot lift you up there, so we will beg that eagle over there", said the king.

\t Didur ža reč’xosi där riyxanu, sosi mitow reč’oƛin, eƛin Ħusenä nesiqor.
\g 
\l "I don't know how to chop it down, you chop first!", said Hussein to him.

\t Boƛƛ’o zaman bik’inosi, kidbä neła nełdaɣor eniw yižin.
\g 
\l In the meantime, the girl took her mother to her own place.

\t Elaygon bitor hunix ik’iƛ’oräy, sidaɣ yisir raqˤäsi bix resun.
\g 
\l While he went on on his way from there, he found thick grass in one place.

\t Ozuri c’axrun kidber riyn ža nełas bašiqˤoy yałrułi.
\g 
\l When the girl saw it, she immediately knew that it was her ring.

\t Buqbetaxor yizi sida iħuz lilyoxor baynosi, muši begiranix bazarganbin, yedan q’ˤida bičin.
\g 
\l Toward sunset, when they came to a river bank, the merchants and he sat down to take a break.

\t Łˤora äƛiru ɣudƛ’ogon xanä bertenno bodin yeɣeni esiw yown.
\g 
\l And on the third day the king arranged a marriage and married the young sister.

\g 
\l "Now I will find out the man who has prepared this food," began the boy.

\t Mekos nece ħal boqzaƛ’, roɣno ozuri teƛnosi dandi, žukani halmaɣä igunir rac’a biša teƛno.
\g 
\l Because the hunger's strength got so big, he took away his eye and gave it to him, and the bad friend gave the good one food to eat, right away.

\t Dicegon bazarganä ħaƛoƛin c’ok’inayn yaħmoƛ’ ayra oqłin, uži et’un k’oƛin ičin ħaƛuxanuƛin.
\g 
\l How much the merchant scolded him to bring him to his conscience: "Drink!", the boy ran away [saying]: "I don't drink."

\t Din zows elo, nucin ragis, zerun ħaƛus, ruy mešok’labi taraw at’iłinč’u.
\g 
\l I was there as well, I ate honey, I drank booze, and indeed only the moustaches got wet!

\t Yigtow yedu ƛ’iri yutinosi, wacʕal žedzoxaɣor ik’a muk’ur oqno.
\g 
\l When she insisted very much, the cousin agreed to go to their [place].

\t Sisgon čuret’ bok’nosi, raładyos bitazoni lilyoxar boqno yizi.
\g 
\l He beat the whip once more and they came to the other coast of the sea.

\t Ža madaxor yaynosi, oƛixno k’oƛin užä, tełxor yoqƛin, iduɣor goƛ’in.
\g 
\l When she came to the door, the boy came running and invited her into the home: "Come inside!"

\t Därgon nesi užix yik’a retin.
\g 
\l And I want to marry that boy too."

\t Eženi esiya beɣet’ani esnazaqor eƛin:
\g 
\l The eldest brother said to his younger brothers:

\t Hemedur neła ɣˤanaza k’edin, bercinaw, q’ˤimaku kid doxturä yown.

\l So and so, that woman found a beautiful girl for the doctor and he married.

\t Elo yisir aɣbi žeda žedaqor xabaryayx teqno, yedu ahli łinaqor rezun ričäsi žin močibi riƛinč’ey.

\l There he heared the birds talking among themselves: "What are those people looking for, why didn't they plow the fields already?

\t Xizyogon ža uži butnoƛ’ pun bok’no äčiru žek’uder ayn.
\g 
\l Then the boy came to a man who was lying on his burka.

\t Q’ˤano äƛiru ƛˤeb yac’nosi, dahawgon bikoris tatu łiyn.
\g 
\l When he ate the second leaf, the snake's power ended a little more.

\t Gogaƛ’ äsuruni žek’a eƛin, yedu dey kero yoł, debi esiwn t’o yołƛin.
\g 
\l The man he found on the meadow said: "This is my ravine, your sister is there as well.

\g 
\l Afterwards he sang a song about this girl:

\t Šebi zowä deber, nełƛ’asi eso miƛin, eƛin ečruni žek’a.
\g 
\l So tell me what you have to tell!", said the old man.

\t Madax gulun bicin xecin, uži Beqes ʕUneyzatdäɣor ik’in.

\t Hemedur yeda zawzay, pandurya tełäzay q’ˤanoquno oc’ino łelaw, q’ˤanoquno oc’ino guluƛ’no zown saldatbi boƛixno.

\t Wayčo, baħarči, egixwa mi däqƛin!” - aħi bodin ceyä.
\g 
\l "Hey, brave young man, I cannot keep you anymore!", warned the eagle.

\t Nesä sadaq royxosi šebin neła ɣˤanazar rukayx zown.

\l That woman was seeing all the things he did.

\l He came, seated his sister onto the horse and lead her into the forest.

\t Yisiqor yigza ħalał baru c’ok’inayn, ƛelin maħ xecin nexzaƛ’.

\l His wife scolded him quite much, because he came and left the lamb outside.

\l While the dog was being searching there, the fox made a hole in some place in the haystack and hurried to set fire to the hay.

\t Xizyo ƛelza eƛin, wey, eni, dice igu aħo yoł elusƛin.
\g 
\l Then the lambs said: "Hey mom, what a good shepherd we have!"

\t Idur bayruntow dahaw mušin begirno, bertenyołer butin yizi.

\l The boy said: "By God, I have come to ask for [the hand of] your daughter."

\t Žedu bužzi boqnoanu, mi iłeni łaciraqa xanes kidbabi rawnč’i, nediwt’a gulubi yołi nay deber riqixƛin.

\g 
\l One day the wife didn't prepare food for him and left him hungry.

\l And and old woman carried it to her home.

\t Xedyosni yołi maʕdinaw tarbiya yołäsi kid zown.

\l The husband, however, had a daughter of pretty upbringing.

\l ("He resembled this man.", she pointed her finger onto her brother.)

\t K’ox äƛirugon uži kikxor łi ric’a ik’in.

\l A second time the boy went to the spring to fill it with water.

\l And immediately when he came to to the spring, the dragon swallowed him alive.

\l And he lifted it with a handkerchief and put it back to the place where it was.

\l The next day the cow was slaughtered.

\l Having drunken heavily, and after it got into his head, he went to bed and slept.

\t Bara xanqor hoboy eluƛ’or oz nexxowaƛin eƛinosi, nesä eƛin, nexłin žedur huni räynč’i.
